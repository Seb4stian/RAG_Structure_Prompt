In the mid-1850s the Coast Salish people of what is now called the Duwamish Tribe and Suquamish, as well as other associated groups and tribes, were living in some 13 villages within the present-day city limits of Seattle. Evidence of continuous human habitation of a village site within the current city limits of the city of Seattle dating back to the 6th century C.E. exists on the Port of Seattle Terminal 107 site, located on the Western bank of the Duwamish River.  The site was abandoned in approximately 1800, for unknown reasons. Other notable village sites include the birthplace of Chief Seattle, which was located near the current footprint of the King Street Station.\nGeorge Vancouver was the first European to visit the Seattle area in May 1792 during his 1791-95 expedition to chart the Pacific Northwest.\nThe founding of Seattle is usually dated from the arrival of the Denny Party scouts on September 25, 1851. However, Luther Collins, Henry Van Asselt, and the Maple family founded a farming settlement on what is currently the Seattle neighborhood of Georgetown on September 27, 1851. The Denny party's original site was an unfinished cabin, without roof, and a camp site, located at Alki Point, in West Seattle. The Collins party settlement was improved with permanent structures, and was soon producing produce and meat for sale and barter. In April, 1852, Arthur A. Denny abandoned the original site at Alki in favor of a better protected site on Elliott Bay that is now part of downtown Seattle. Arthur A. Denny and Luther Collins were the first commissioners of King County after its creation in 1852. Around the same time, David Swinson \"Doc\" Maynard began settling the land immediately south of Denny's.\nSeattle in its early decades relied on the timber industry, shipping logs (and later, milled timber) to San Francisco. A climax forest of trees up to 1,000\u20132,000 years old and towering as high as nearly 400 ft (122 m) covered much of what is now Seattle. Today, none of that size remain anywhere in the world.\nWhen Henry Yesler brought the first steam sawmill to the region, he chose a location on the waterfront where Maynard and Denny's plats met. Thereafter Seattle would dominate the lumber industry.\nCharlie Terry sold out Alki (which, after his departure barely held on as a settlement), moved to Seattle and began acquiring land. He either owned or partially owned Seattle's first timber ships. He eventually gave a land grant to the University of the Territory of Washington (later University of Washington), and was instrumental in the politics to establish an urban infrastructure.\nThe logging town developed rapidly over decades into a small city. Despite being officially founded by the Methodists of the Denny Party, Seattle quickly developed a reputation as a wide-open town, a haven for prostitution, liquor, and gambling. Some attribute this, at least in part, to Maynard who realized that something was needed to bring the loggers and sailors, who formed the majority of the surrounding population, to town.\nReal estate records show that nearly all of the city's first 60 businesses were on, or immediately adjacent to, Maynard's plat.\nAll of this occurred against a background of sometimes rocky relations with the local Native American population, including a nominally pitched battle, the Battle of Seattle, January 25, 1856.\nSeattle was incorporated as a town January 14, 1865."

Additionally, a new zoning code was implemented, resulting in a downtown area of more durable structures. Despite the devastation caused by the fire, Seattle was able to quickly recover and rebuild, maintaining its open city atmosphere south of Yesler Way.",

                "== World War II ==\n\nFollowing Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. entered World War II and the whole Puget Sound region was full on rolling in the nation's war effort. Among the chief priority was the federal government's sudden desire for tens of thousands of planes a year, and Boeing was positioned to provide them. Working under fixed-fee contracts, Boeing churned out aircraft and became by far the largest employer in Seattle. During the war, Seattle ranked as one of the top three cities in the nation in contracts per capita, and Washington state ranked as one of the top two in the nation for war contracts per capita. Seattle and Renton produced 8,200 planes, including 6,981 B-17s and more than 1,000 B-29 bombers. Civilian use of Boeing Field was greatly curtailed to accommodate the production of thousands of Boeing bombers. To accommodate the war effort, the U.S. military also annexed McChord Field in Tacoma, prompting that city to plead with the Port of Seattle to develop Seattle-Tacoma International Airport at Bow Lake -- midway between the Sound's two major cities.\nPuget Sound-area shipyards constructed a large number of war vessels. At the combined Todd Shipyards/Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding operation, 33,000 men and women worked in Tacoma to build five freighters, two transports, 37 escort carriers, five gasoline tankers, and three destroyer tenders. At the Seattle yards, 22,000 employees built 46 destroyers and three tenders for the United States Navy, plus other vessels. The Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, now annexed to Kirkland, employed 6,000 workers to repair dozens of merchant vessels and ferries during the war and to turn out ships for the Navy. The shipyard site is now the location of Carillon Point, a residential-commercial development. 15 smaller shipyards in Seattle and other cities in the Puget Sound area also produced vessels for the war effort.\nThe war also attracted tens of thousands of workers from across the country, as the greatly expanded wartime production quickly exhausted local labor pools. Of the five million rural southern African-Americans migrating to the industrial North and West during the second wave of the Great Migration, an estimated 45,000 went to the Pacific Northwest, of which 10,000 moved to Seattle. Most African American workers came to Seattle as shipyard employees, and by summer 1942, the National Youth Administration brought to the city the first group of blacks to work for Boeing. By war's end, 4,078 (7 percent) of the 60,328 shipyard workers in Seattle were African Americans. AA's also found work as non-military government employees. Of 18,862 federal employees in Seattle in 1945, 1,019 (5 percent) were black. Moreover, the 4,000 black soldiers and sailors stationed at Fort Lawton in Seattle and other military installations nearby contributed to the new employment diversity of the African American population. As a result, between 1940 and 1950, Seattle's black population grew 413 percent, from 3,789 to 15,666.

            "reference_answer": "The involvement of the Puget Sound region in World War II had a significant impact on the local economy and workforce. Boeing became the largest employer in Seattle, producing tens of thousands of planes for the war effort. Seattle and Renton alone produced 8,200 planes, including bombers like the B-17 and B-29. Shipyards in the area also constructed a large number of war vessels, with thousands of men and women working to build various types of ships. The war effort attracted tens of thousands of workers from across the country to the region, as the demand for wartime production quickly exhausted local labor pools. Additionally, the influx of African American workers, including shipyard employees and federal government workers, contributed to the growth of Seattle's black population and increased diversity in the workforce. The involvement in aircraft and ship production during World War II significantly boosted the local economy and provided employment opportunities for many in the Puget Sound region.",

                "== World War II ==\n\nFollowing Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. entered World War II and the whole Puget Sound region was full on rolling in the nation's war effort. Among the chief priority was the federal government's sudden desire for tens of thousands of planes a year, and Boeing was positioned to provide them. Working under fixed-fee contracts, Boeing churned out aircraft and became by far the largest employer in Seattle. During the war, Seattle ranked as one of the top three cities in the nation in contracts per capita, and Washington state ranked as one of the top two in the nation for war contracts per capita. Seattle and Renton produced 8,200 planes, including 6,981 B-17s and more than 1,000 B-29 bombers. Civilian use of Boeing Field was greatly curtailed to accommodate the production of thousands of Boeing bombers. To accommodate the war effort, the U.S. military also annexed McChord Field in Tacoma, prompting that city to plead with the Port of Seattle to develop Seattle-Tacoma International Airport at Bow Lake -- midway between the Sound's two major cities.\nPuget Sound-area shipyards constructed a large number of war vessels. At the combined Todd Shipyards/Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding operation, 33,000 men and women worked in Tacoma to build five freighters, two transports, 37 escort carriers, five gasoline tankers, and three destroyer tenders. At the Seattle yards, 22,000 employees built 46 destroyers and three tenders for the United States Navy, plus other vessels. The Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, now annexed to Kirkland, employed 6,000 workers to repair dozens of merchant vessels and ferries during the war and to turn out ships for the Navy. The shipyard site is now the location of Carillon Point, a residential-commercial development. 15 smaller shipyards in Seattle and other cities in the Puget Sound area also produced vessels for the war effort.\nThe war also attracted tens of thousands of workers from across the country, as the greatly expanded wartime production quickly exhausted local labor pools. Of the five million rural southern African-Americans migrating to the industrial North and West during the second wave of the Great Migration, an estimated 45,000 went to the Pacific Northwest, of which 10,000 moved to Seattle. Most African American workers came to Seattle as shipyard employees, and by summer 1942, the National Youth Administration brought to the city the first group of blacks to work for Boeing. By war's end, 4,078 (7 percent) of the 60,328 shipyard workers in Seattle were African Americans. AA's also found work as non-military government employees. Of 18,862 federal employees in Seattle in 1945, 1,019 (5 percent) were black. Moreover, the 4,000 black soldiers and sailors stationed at Fort Lawton in Seattle and other military installations nearby contributed to the new employment diversity of the African American population. As a result, between 1940 and 1950, Seattle's black population grew 413 percent, from 3,789 to 15,666.   The newcomers became permanent residents, building up black political influence, strengthening civil rights organizations such as the NAACP, and calling for antidiscrimination legislation. On the negative side, racial tensions increased, both black and white residential areas deteriorated from overcrowding, and inside the black community there were angry words between \"old settlers\" and recent arrivals for leadership in the black communities.\n\n\n=== Japanese American community ===\n\nJapanese-Americans living in the Pacific Northwest were heavily affected by the war; President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the removal of 110,000 Japanese immigrants and ethnic Japanese citizens from the West Coast to internment camps inland, relocating 7,000 people from the Seattle area alone.

However, this period of stagnation soon ended with the rise of the jet aircraft and Boeing's reincarnation as the world's leading producer of commercial passenger planes.\nWith all the post-war growth came growing pollution of the lakes and rivers that provided much of beauty that had been Seattle's appeal to its recent immigrants. Also, the sprawl constantly demanded more roads, since the ones already built had terrible traffic. Jim Ellis and other Seattle natives, anxious to preserve the city in which they grew up, came together to institute the Metropolitan Problems Committee, or METRO, intended to manage and plan the metropolitan area. The original, comprehensive METRO regional plan was defeated in a vote by the suburbanites;\nMETRO came back, scaled down to a sewage treatment and transport organization; METRO was eventually merged into the King County government.\nDuring this period, Seattle attempted to counter the decline of its downtown and the area immediately to the north by hosting the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. The fair, given a futuristic science theme, was designed to leave behind a civic center, now known as Seattle Center, including arts buildings, the Pacific Science Center and the Space Needle, and serving also as a fairground. In addition, freeways were built to compensate for all this new growth for people to commute. Most of the Eastside (east of Lake Washington) and northern suburbs came into being during the Boeing boom, as did Interstate Highways (I-5 and I-90). I-5 neatly cut off Downtown Seattle from Capitol Hill and First Hill.\nIn conjunction with the fair, a demonstration monorail line was constructed at no cost to the city and was paid for out of ticket sales, and then turned over to the city for $600,000. (See Seattle Center Monorail.) It is now mostly a tourist attraction. The World's Fair arguably reenergized the downtown of Seattle, and was generally a smashing success, even finishing with a profit.\nAfter the war, the University of Washington also took a step forward, finally fulfilling the promise of its name under university president Charles Odegaard. Starting in the late 1950s, Seattle was one of the centers of the emergence of the American counter-culture and culture of protest.

The city is politically still largely progressive, with about three quarters of a million people.\nIn 2023, Seattle became the first city in the United States to ban discrimination based on caste.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTimeline of Seattle\nSeattle Police Department\n\n\n== References ==\n\nMuch of the content of this page is from \"Seattle: Booms and Busts\", by Emmett Shear, who has granted blanket permission for material from that paper to be reused in Wikipedia.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nBlackford, Mansel G. \"Reform Politics in Seattle During the Progressive Era, 1902-1916.\" Pacific Northwest Quarterly 59.4 (1968): 177-185 online\nBrown, Frederick L.\u2009 \"Cows in the Commons, Dogs on the Lawn: A History of Animals in Seattle\" (PhD dissertation, University of Washington\u2009ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, \u20092010.\u20093431517).\nCockburn, Alexander, and Jeffrey St Clair.

                "The history of Bogot\u00e1 refers to the history of the area surrounding the Colombian capital Bogot\u00e1. The area around Bogot\u00e1 was first populated by groups of indigenous people that migrated from mesoamerica. Among these groups were the Muisca (the Chibcha speaking people) that settled on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense in what is now Cundinamarca and Boyac\u00e1. With the arrival of the Spanish colonizers the area was developed into a major settlement that was founded by Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada in 1538, and became capital of the Spanish Empire provinces and the seat of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. With independence, Bogot\u00e1 became the capital of the Gran Colombia, and -subsequently- of the Republic of Colombia.\n\n\n== Pre-Columbian era ==\n\nThe first indigenous people inhabiting Bogot\u00e1 were the Muisca, who spoke Chibcha. At the arrival of the conquerors, the Muisca has been estimated to consist of 110,000 to two million people. The Muisca occupied the mild-climate highlands between the Sumapaz mountains to the southwest and the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy in the northeast. They lived within an approximate area of 25,000 km2 (9,700 sq mi), which comprised Bogot\u00e1's high plateau, the current Boyac\u00e1 department portion, and a small part of Santander. The most fertile lands were ancient Pleistocene lake beds, remnants of Lake Humboldt, forming the Bogot\u00e1 savanna, an area called Bacat\u00e1, and regions irrigated by the Bogot\u00e1, Su\u00e1rez and Chicamocha Rivers.\nPolitically, the area formed part of the Muisca Confederation with the northern ruler called zaque (ruling from Hunza, present-day Tunja) and the southern ruler, based in Bacat\u00e1, the zipa. The Muisca were predominantly farmers and traders and formed a dispersed population occupying numerous small villages and settlements with wooden and clay houses, called boh\u00edos by the Spanish. The iraca of sacred City of the Sun Sugamuxi was the principal religious leader. Other rulers were Tundama in the city of the same name, now called Duitama and various independent caciques, mainly of Guatavita, Ubat\u00e9, Ubaque and V\u00e9lez. The original hunter-gatherer population of the Herrera Period, predating the Muisca, slowly changed into a sedentary community based on agriculture. The people cultivated maize, potatoes, beans, tomatoes, tubers, such as yuca, tobacco, arracacha, sweet potatoes and various fruits and vegetables. The Muisca people were called \"Salt People\", due to their extraction of salt from brines in large pots. The main salt mines were and are still in Zipaquir\u00e1, Nemoc\u00f3n and Tausa, at the northern edge of the Bogot\u00e1 savanna. Emeralds were mined in Chivor and Somondoco and traded with the Muzo, who were called the \"Emerald People\". Cotton was cultivated by the higher-altitude neighbours, such as the Lache and U'wa to the north.\n\n\n=== Bacat\u00e1 in Muisca history ===\n\n\n=== Mythology and religion ===\n\nCh\u00eda was Zipa's territory ceremonial center, a place designed for moon worship, while the Zaque's ceremonial center was Sogamoso, where the Sun temple was located. Apparently, the major Muisca priest's function was astronomic observation. Numerous archeological monuments in the form of stone columns witness the relation, such as \"Cojines del Diablo\" (Devil's Cushions) two large discs carved high up in the rock within Tunja urban perimeter, which were probably Moon observation sites. At Saquenzipa, ceremonial center near Villa de Leyva, some 25 large cylindrical columns aligned in the east-west direction stand: from this place, on summer solstice day the sun rises exactly over Iguaque lake from where Bachu\u00e9 goddess emerged as the legend tells.\nBochica, the civilizing God taught them manual arts, gave them moral standards, and subsequently saved them from deluge and Sabana flood by breaking the rock and letting the water flow to form Tequendama falls. The goddess Chia was the moon, Zuh\u00e9 the sun. They worshiped other various astral gods. For the Muisca, lakes were sacred places where they had their ceremonies. Their most important myths and legends mention Guatavita, Siecha, Tota, F\u00faquene, and Iguacu lakes, where gold and ceramic gifts have been found. They also worshiped the dead, nobles and chiefs were mummified and buried with all their belongings."

With the arrival of the Spanish colonizers the area was developed into a major settlement that was founded by Gonzalo Jim\u00e9nez de Quesada in 1538, and became capital of the Spanish Empire provinces and the seat of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. With independence, Bogot\u00e1 became the capital of the Gran Colombia, and -subsequently- of the Republic of Colombia.\n\n\n== Pre-Columbian era ==\n\nThe first indigenous people inhabiting Bogot\u00e1 were the Muisca, who spoke Chibcha. At the arrival of the conquerors, the Muisca has been estimated to consist of 110,000 to two million people. The Muisca occupied the mild-climate highlands between the Sumapaz mountains to the southwest and the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy in the northeast. They lived within an approximate area of 25,000 km2 (9,700 sq mi), which comprised Bogot\u00e1's high plateau, the current Boyac\u00e1 department portion, and a small part of Santander. The most fertile lands were ancient Pleistocene lake beds, remnants of Lake Humboldt, forming the Bogot\u00e1 savanna, an area called Bacat\u00e1, and regions irrigated by the Bogot\u00e1, Su\u00e1rez and Chicamocha Rivers.\nPolitically, the area formed part of the Muisca Confederation with the northern ruler called zaque (ruling from Hunza, present-day Tunja) and the southern ruler, based in Bacat\u00e1, the zipa. The Muisca were predominantly farmers and traders and formed a dispersed population occupying numerous small villages and settlements with wooden and clay houses, called boh\u00edos by the Spanish. The iraca of sacred City of the Sun Sugamuxi was the principal religious leader. Other rulers were Tundama in the city of the same name, now called Duitama and various independent caciques, mainly of Guatavita, Ubat\u00e9, Ubaque and V\u00e9lez. The original hunter-gatherer population of the Herrera Period, predating the Muisca, slowly changed into a sedentary community based on agriculture. The people cultivated maize, potatoes, beans, tomatoes, tubers, such as yuca, tobacco, arracacha, sweet potatoes and various fruits and vegetables. The Muisca people were called \"Salt People\", due to their extraction of salt from brines in large pots. The main salt mines were and are still in Zipaquir\u00e1, Nemoc\u00f3n and Tausa, at the northern edge of the Bogot\u00e1 savanna. Emeralds were mined in Chivor and Somondoco and traded with the Muzo, who were called the \"Emerald People\". Cotton was cultivated by the higher-altitude neighbours, such as the Lache and U'wa to the north.\n\n\n=== Bacat\u00e1 in Muisca history ===\n\n\n=== Mythology and religion ===\n\nCh\u00eda was Zipa's territory ceremonial center, a place designed for moon worship, while the Zaque's ceremonial center was Sogamoso, where the Sun temple was located. Apparently, the major Muisca priest's function was astronomic observation. Numerous archeological monuments in the form of stone columns witness the relation, such as \"Cojines del Diablo\" (Devil's Cushions) two large discs carved high up in the rock within Tunja urban perimeter, which were probably Moon observation sites. At Saquenzipa, ceremonial center near Villa de Leyva, some 25 large cylindrical columns aligned in the east-west direction stand: from this place, on summer solstice day the sun rises exactly over Iguaque lake from where Bachu\u00e9 goddess emerged as the legend tells.\nBochica, the civilizing God taught them manual arts, gave them moral standards, and subsequently saved them from deluge and Sabana flood by breaking the rock and letting the water flow to form Tequendama falls. The goddess Chia was the moon, Zuh\u00e9 the sun. They worshiped other various astral gods. For the Muisca, lakes were sacred places where they had their ceremonies. Their most important myths and legends mention Guatavita, Siecha, Tota, F\u00faquene, and Iguacu lakes, where gold and ceramic gifts have been found. They also worshiped the dead, nobles and chiefs were mummified and buried with all their belongings."

As the Borbon dynasty took the throne in Spain, French artistic styles began to dominate, shaping the artistic preferences of the colonies. Religious themes began to give way to more secular subjects, and French style became prominent in government, high Creole society, and within the church hierarchy. This shift led to a greater emphasis on personal portraits, with artists like Joaqu\u00edn Guti\u00e9rrez becoming well-known for their portraiture during this time.

In 1898 the rails reached Anapoima and in 1908 the rails linked the city and Facatativ\u00e1. From that time Bogotanians were able to mobilize down to the Magdalena river using the rail road. Bogot\u00e1-Chapinero-Puente del Com\u00fan section was inaugurated in 1894, Cajic\u00e1 in 1896 and Zipaquir\u00e1 in 1898.

Alberto Urdaneta was the first director. Painters Epifanio Garay and Ricardo Acevedo Bernal, School professors, were important portraitists, but the most outstanding person at that time was painter Andr\u00e9s de Santamar\u00eda (1860\u20131945), greatly renowned painting in Colombia. He was Beaux Arts School director twice and his work, associated to impressionism, is the most important of that time.

His poetic work in the novel De sobremesa position him in an outstanding American literature place. Rafael Pombo (1833\u20131912) was outstanding American romanticism poet who left a collection of fables essential part of children imagination and Colombian tradition.\n\n\n=== Railroad ===\nThe railroad to join Bogot\u00e1 and the Carare and Magdalena Rivers dates back to radicalism times, but only started shaping when the first railroad section to Girardot was built, under government contract with Francisco Javier Cisneros in 1881, the first section of which joined the Magdalena port and Tocaima. In 1898 the rails reached Anapoima and in 1908 the rails linked the city and Facatativ\u00e1. From that time Bogotanians were able to mobilize down to the Magdalena river using the rail road. Bogot\u00e1-Chapinero-Puente del Com\u00fan section was inaugurated in 1894, Cajic\u00e1 in 1896 and Zipaquir\u00e1 in 1898. Including Soacha and Sibat\u00e9 rails by the end of the nineteenth century, Sabana de Bogot\u00e1 counted on one hundred railroad kilometers.\n\n\n=== Telephone ===\nThe first telephone line in Bogot\u00e1 linked from September 21, 1881, the National Palace and city mail and telegraph offices, and on August 14, 1884, the municipality of Bogot\u00e1 granted Cuban citizen Jos\u00e9 Raimundo Mart\u00ednez the privilege to install public telephone services in the city.

Residencia project was  successfully overcome by Heredia who later \"residenced\" Santacruz for his greed in the expedition made by him to Urab\u00e1 in late 1537.\nIn its typical decentralised and autonomistic state policy, Spain put in Cartagena de Indias, a most interesting seafaring town,  many administrative offices:\n\nThe Royal Houses of Customs, \"La Aduana\": Technically the Main directorate for Customs policy in New Granada and its dependencies. Cartagena de Indias's mayors office today  is now located there.\nThe Royal Houses of Accountance: Most of its competences were in the State Finance area, making it analogous to a Ministry of Finance  or a Secretary of the Treasury. This office was located in what is today Mapfre's  House at La Inquisicion Street.\nThe Royal Mail House: Although dealing already in 1540 it became  developed in the 18th century,  staying there till 1821 when it was renamed with the Independence, delivering  most of the post in New Granada and to Europe. Today's SUDEB's house occupies its original place.\nThe Royal Consulate of Commerce of Cartagena de Indias: A privately run institution with public charter, the Consulates of Commerce were express courts for trading quarrels and to promote trade and development in its area. Until 1790 was the only in the area, then succeeded by Caracas (1790), Santa Cruz de Mompox (1793), Panam\u00e1 (1798), Santa Fe (1805) and others.\nThe sea farers Hospital: First and Only military hospital in the area, and until the foundation  of the San Juan De Dios Hospital in Bogota the only in New Granada. On  its first floor a Poor People's Hospital worked until the San Carlos Hospital in 1730 and the Poors Hospital were  opened up in the Santa Clara convent. Today's Naval Museum, with the poor's Hospital in its first floor for a while, they were replaced by those on Gastelbondo Street (San Carlos), and today's Sofitel Santa Clara Hotel, formerly the \"Poors Hospital of Santa Clara of Assisi\".\nHeadquarters of the Royal Regular Armies of Cartagena de Indias: In New Granada, like in most Spanish America, military presence was at least nule and when present was quite concentrated in the important towns : Havana, Mexico City, Lima, Panama and Cartagena de Indias. The permanent  army post in New Granada had its headquarters in today's Judges Offices in Cuartel Street. This made Cartagena de Indias also the seat to something similar to a Ministry of Defense in a modern country.\n\n17th century:\n\nDuring the governorship of Rafael C\u00e1psir an interesting event occurred in the city: the \"Cessatio a Divinis\"."

While Desjean only asked for 250,000 Spanish reales in ransom, Jean du Casse stayed a few months later and dishonored the promise of the Baron of respecting the churches and holy places and left them with nothing. The city again, lost everything. The 18th century begins.\nOther important events in the 16th and 17th centuries were:\n16th century:\n\nThe brother of the founder, Pedro de Heredia, Alonso de Heredia founded Santa Cruz de Mompox to honour the then  governor of the province, Jos\u00e9 de Santacruz who was about to make another unjust Residencia, sort of appointment,  to his brother, planned by his enemies in the city.  Residencia project was  successfully overcome by Heredia who later \"residenced\" Santacruz for his greed in the expedition made by him to Urab\u00e1 in late 1537.\nIn its typical decentralised and autonomistic state policy, Spain put in Cartagena de Indias, a most interesting seafaring town,  many administrative offices:\n\nThe Royal Houses of Customs, \"La Aduana\": Technically the Main directorate for Customs policy in New Granada and its dependencies. Cartagena de Indias's mayors office today  is now located there.\nThe Royal Houses of Accountance: Most of its competences were in the State Finance area, making it analogous to a Ministry of Finance  or a Secretary of the Treasury. This office was located in what is today Mapfre's  House at La Inquisicion Street.\nThe Royal Mail House: Although dealing already in 1540 it became  developed in the 18th century,  staying there till 1821 when it was renamed with the Independence, delivering  most of the post in New Granada and to Europe. Today's SUDEB's house occupies its original place.\nThe Royal Consulate of Commerce of Cartagena de Indias: A privately run institution with public charter, the Consulates of Commerce were express courts for trading quarrels and to promote trade and development in its area. Until 1790 was the only in the area, then succeeded by Caracas (1790), Santa Cruz de Mompox (1793), Panam\u00e1 (1798), Santa Fe (1805) and others.\nThe sea farers Hospital: First and Only military hospital in the area, and until the foundation  of the San Juan De Dios Hospital in Bogota the only in New Granada. On  its first floor a Poor People's Hospital worked until the San Carlos Hospital in 1730 and the Poors Hospital were  opened up in the Santa Clara convent. Today's Naval Museum, with the poor's Hospital in its first floor for a while, they were replaced by those on Gastelbondo Street (San Carlos), and today's Sofitel Santa Clara Hotel, formerly the \"Poors Hospital of Santa Clara of Assisi\".\nHeadquarters of the Royal Regular Armies of Cartagena de Indias: In New Granada, like in most Spanish America, military presence was at least nule and when present was quite concentrated in the important towns : Havana, Mexico City, Lima, Panama and Cartagena de Indias. The permanent  army post in New Granada had its headquarters in today's Judges Offices in Cuartel Street. This made Cartagena de Indias also the seat to something similar to a Ministry of Defense in a modern country.\n\n17th century:\n\nDuring the governorship of Rafael C\u00e1psir an interesting event occurred in the city: the \"Cessatio a Divinis\"."

            "reference_answer": "The Raid on Cartagena, led by Sir Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis, in 1697 was intended to be more than just pillaging - it was a full-scale invasion with the goal of helping King Louis XIV's grandson, Felipe V, assert his rights to the Spanish Habsburg throne. However, the governor of Saint-Domingue, Jean Baptiste Ducasse, had conflicting intentions as he brought his soldiers to steal and plunder, turning the original plan into chaos and destruction.\n\nDesjean's invasion faced difficulties due to the recently finished walls and forts surrounding the city, which made the victory slow and costly. Despite Desjean's initial request for a ransom of 250,000 Spanish reales, Jean du Casse, who arrived later, dishonored the agreement and left the city with nothing, causing it to lose everything once again.\n\nThe impact of the Raid on Cartagena was significant for the city's development. While it recovered quickly from previous attacks and continued to expand, the invasion by Desjean and the subsequent actions of Ducasse left the city in ruins and set back its progress. The conflicting intentions of the two leaders led to a loss of resources and stability for Cartagena, affecting its growth and prosperity in the 18th century.",

                "== Binary logic ==\n\n\n=== Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz ===\n\n \nIn 1702, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed logic in a formal, mathematical sense with his writings on the binary numeral system. Leibniz simplified the binary system and articulated logical properties such as conjunction, disjunction, negation, identity, inclusion, and the empty set. He anticipated Lagrangian interpolation and algorithmic information theory. His calculus ratiocinator anticipated aspects of the universal Turing machine. In 1961, Norbert Wiener suggested that Leibniz should be considered the patron saint of cybernetics. Wiener is quoted with \"Indeed, the general idea of a computing machine is nothing but a mechanization of Leibniz's Calculus Ratiocinator.\" But it took more than a century before George Boole published his Boolean algebra in 1854 with a complete system that allowed computational processes to be mathematically modeled.\nBy this time, the first mechanical devices driven by a binary pattern had been invented. The industrial revolution had driven forward the mechanization of many tasks, and this included weaving. Punched cards controlled Joseph Marie Jacquard's loom in 1801, where a hole punched in the card indicated a binary one and an unpunched spot indicated a binary zero. Jacquard's loom was far from being a computer, but it did illustrate that machines could be driven by binary systems and stored binary information.\n\n\n== Emergence of a discipline ==\n\n\n=== Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace ===\n\nCharles Babbage is often regarded as one of the first pioneers of computing. Beginning in the 1810s, Babbage had a vision of mechanically computing numbers and tables. Putting this into reality, Babbage designed a calculator to compute numbers up to 8 decimal points long. Continuing with the success of this idea, Babbage worked to develop a machine that could compute numbers with up to 20 decimal places. By the 1830s, Babbage had devised a plan to develop a machine that could use punched cards to perform arithmetical operations.

                "== Binary logic ==\n\n\n=== Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz ===\n\n \nIn 1702, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed logic in a formal, mathematical sense with his writings on the binary numeral system. Leibniz simplified the binary system and articulated logical properties such as conjunction, disjunction, negation, identity, inclusion, and the empty set. He anticipated Lagrangian interpolation and algorithmic information theory. His calculus ratiocinator anticipated aspects of the universal Turing machine. In 1961, Norbert Wiener suggested that Leibniz should be considered the patron saint of cybernetics. Wiener is quoted with \"Indeed, the general idea of a computing machine is nothing but a mechanization of Leibniz's Calculus Ratiocinator.\" But it took more than a century before George Boole published his Boolean algebra in 1854 with a complete system that allowed computational processes to be mathematically modeled.\nBy this time, the first mechanical devices driven by a binary pattern had been invented. The industrial revolution had driven forward the mechanization of many tasks, and this included weaving. Punched cards controlled Joseph Marie Jacquard's loom in 1801, where a hole punched in the card indicated a binary one and an unpunched spot indicated a binary zero. Jacquard's loom was far from being a computer, but it did illustrate that machines could be driven by binary systems and stored binary information.\n\n\n== Emergence of a discipline ==\n\n\n=== Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace ===\n\nCharles Babbage is often regarded as one of the first pioneers of computing. Beginning in the 1810s, Babbage had a vision of mechanically computing numbers and tables. Putting this into reality, Babbage designed a calculator to compute numbers up to 8 decimal points long. Continuing with the success of this idea, Babbage worked to develop a machine that could compute numbers with up to 20 decimal places. By the 1830s, Babbage had devised a plan to develop a machine that could use punched cards to perform arithmetical operations. The machine would store numbers in memory units, and there would be a form of sequential control.  This means that one operation would be carried out before another in such a way that the machine would produce an answer and not fail. This machine was to be known as the \"Analytical Engine\", which was the first true representation of what is the modern computer.\n\nAda Lovelace (Augusta Ada Byron) is credited as the pioneer of computer programming and is regarded as a mathematical genius.

Von Neumann architecture accepts fractions and instructions as data types. Finally, as the von Neumann architecture is a simple one, its register management is also simple.

                "Pure mathematics is the study of mathematical concepts independently of any application outside mathematics. These concepts may originate in real-world concerns, and the results obtained may later turn out to be useful for practical applications, but pure mathematicians are not primarily motivated by such applications. Instead, the appeal is attributed to the intellectual challenge and aesthetic beauty of working out the logical consequences of basic principles.\nWhile pure mathematics has existed as an activity since at least ancient Greece, the concept was elaborated upon around the year 1900, after the introduction of theories with counter-intuitive properties (such as non-Euclidean geometries and Cantor's theory of infinite sets), and the discovery of apparent paradoxes (such as continuous functions that are nowhere differentiable, and Russell's paradox). This introduced the need to renew the concept of mathematical rigor and rewrite all mathematics accordingly, with a systematic use of axiomatic methods. This led many mathematicians to focus on mathematics for its own sake, that is, pure mathematics.\nNevertheless, almost all mathematical theories remained motivated by problems coming from the real world or from less abstract mathematical theories. Also, many mathematical theories, which had seemed to be totally pure mathematics, were eventually used in applied areas, mainly physics and computer science. A famous early example is Isaac Newton's demonstration that his law of universal gravitation implied that planets move in orbits that are conic sections, geometrical curves that had been studied in antiquity by Apollonius.

Non-Euclidean geometries challenged the traditional Euclidean geometry by presenting geometrical systems where the parallel postulate does not hold. Cantor's theory of infinite sets introduced the concept of different sizes of infinity, which was initially met with skepticism and resistance.\n\nThe implications of these theories were profound. They forced mathematicians to reconsider fundamental assumptions and definitions in mathematics, leading to the development of new branches of mathematics and the exploration of abstract concepts.

                "Pure mathematics is the study of mathematical concepts independently of any application outside mathematics. These concepts may originate in real-world concerns, and the results obtained may later turn out to be useful for practical applications, but pure mathematicians are not primarily motivated by such applications. Instead, the appeal is attributed to the intellectual challenge and aesthetic beauty of working out the logical consequences of basic principles.\nWhile pure mathematics has existed as an activity since at least ancient Greece, the concept was elaborated upon around the year 1900, after the introduction of theories with counter-intuitive properties (such as non-Euclidean geometries and Cantor's theory of infinite sets), and the discovery of apparent paradoxes (such as continuous functions that are nowhere differentiable, and Russell's paradox). This introduced the need to renew the concept of mathematical rigor and rewrite all mathematics accordingly, with a systematic use of axiomatic methods. This led many mathematicians to focus on mathematics for its own sake, that is, pure mathematics.\nNevertheless, almost all mathematical theories remained motivated by problems coming from the real world or from less abstract mathematical theories. Also, many mathematical theories, which had seemed to be totally pure mathematics, were eventually used in applied areas, mainly physics and computer science. A famous early example is Isaac Newton's demonstration that his law of universal gravitation implied that planets move in orbits that are conic sections, geometrical curves that had been studied in antiquity by Apollonius. Another example is the problem of factoring large integers, which is the basis of the RSA cryptosystem, widely used to secure internet communications.\nIt follows that, presently, the distinction between pure and applied mathematics is more a philosophical point of view or a mathematician's preference rather than a rigid subdivision of mathematics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient Greece ===\nAncient Greek mathematicians were among the earliest to make a distinction between pure and applied mathematics.

            "reference_answer": "Generality in pure mathematics refers to the idea of extending mathematical concepts to encompass a broader range of situations or structures. This trend towards increased generality in mathematics has several uses and advantages. Firstly, generalizing theorems or mathematical structures can lead to a deeper understanding of the original concepts. It can also simplify the presentation of material, making proofs shorter and easier to follow. Additionally, generality can help avoid duplication of effort by proving a general result instead of multiple separate cases, or by utilizing results from different areas of mathematics. It can also facilitate connections between different branches of mathematics, allowing for a more cohesive understanding of the subject as a whole.\n\nHowever, the impact of generality on intuition in mathematics can vary depending on the individual and the subject matter. While some may see generality as hindering intuition, it can also serve as an aid by providing analogies to familiar concepts and expanding one's understanding of the underlying principles.\n\nExamples of branches of mathematics that have seen a rise in abstraction in the mid-20th century include abstract algebra, mathematical analysis, and functional analysis. These areas have developed many sub-specialties and connections to both pure and applied mathematics disciplines. The Erlangen program, for instance, expanded the study of geometry to include non-Euclidean geometries and topology by viewing geometry as the study of a space together with a group of transformations.

While both fields involve working with data, data science is more of an interdisciplinary field that involves the application of statistical, computational, and machine learning methods to extract insights from data and make predictions, while data analysis is more focused on the examination and interpretation of data to identify patterns and trends.\nData analysis typically involves working with smaller, structured datasets to answer specific questions or solve specific problems. This can involve tasks such as data cleaning, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and develop hypotheses about relationships between variables. Data analysts typically use statistical methods to test these hypotheses and draw conclusions from the data. For example, a data analyst might analyze sales data to identify trends in customer behavior and make recommendations for marketing strategies.\nData science, on the other hand, is a more complex and iterative process that involves working with larger, more complex datasets that often require advanced computational and statistical methods to analyze. Data scientists often work with unstructured data such as text or images and use machine learning algorithms to build predictive models and make data-driven decisions. In addition to statistical analysis, data science often involves tasks such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection. For instance, a data scientist might develop a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform by analyzing user behavior patterns and using machine learning algorithms to predict user preferences.\nWhile data analysis focuses on extracting insights from existing data, data science goes beyond that by incorporating the development and implementation of predictive models to make informed decisions. Data scientists are often responsible for collecting and cleaning data, selecting appropriate analytical techniques, and deploying models in real-world scenarios. They work at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and domain expertise to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in large datasets.\nDespite these differences, data science and data analysis are closely related fields and often require similar skill sets. Both fields require a solid foundation in statistics, programming, and data visualization, as well as the ability to communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. Both fields benefit from critical thinking and domain knowledge, as understanding the context and nuances of the data is essential for accurate analysis and modeling.\nIn summary, data analysis and data science are distinct yet interconnected disciplines within the broader field of data management and analysis. Data analysis focuses on extracting insights and drawing conclusions from structured data, while data science involves a more comprehensive approach that combines statistical analysis, computational methods, and machine learning to extract insights, build predictive models, and drive data-driven decision-making.

The Act charged the Secretary of Commerce with fostering air commerce, issuing and enforcing air traffic rules, licensing pilots, certifying aircraft, establishing airways, and operating and maintaining aids to air navigation. The newly created Aeronautics Branch, operating under the Department of Commerce assumed primary responsibility for aviation oversight.\nIn fulfilling its civil aviation responsibilities, the U.S. Department of Commerce initially concentrated on such functions as safety regulations and the certification of pilots and aircraft. It took over the building and operation of the nation's system of lighted airways, a task initiated by the Post Office Department. The Department of Commerce improved aeronautical radio communications\u2014before the founding of the Federal Communications Commission in 1934, which handles most such matters today\u2014and introduced radio beacons as an effective aid to air navigation.\nThe Aeronautics Branch was renamed the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1934 to reflect its enhanced status within the Department. As commercial flying increased, the Bureau encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers for providing air traffic control (ATC) along the airways. In 1936, the Bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the ATC system. The pioneer air traffic controllers used maps, blackboards, and mental calculations to ensure the safe separation of aircraft traveling along designated routes between cities.\nIn 1938, the Civil Aeronautics Act transferred the federal civil aviation responsibilities from the Commerce Department to a new independent agency, the Civil Aeronautics Authority. The legislation also expanded the government's role by giving the CAA the authority and the power to regulate airline fares and to determine the routes that air carriers would serve.\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt split the authority into two agencies in 1940: the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). CAA was responsible for ATC, airman and aircraft certification, safety enforcement, and airway development. CAB was entrusted with safety regulation, accident investigation, and economic regulation of the airlines. The CAA was part of the Department of Commerce. The CAB was an independent federal agency.\nOn the eve of America's entry into World War II, CAA began to extend its ATC responsibilities to takeoff and landing operations at airports. This expanded role eventually became permanent after the war. The application of radar to ATC helped controllers in their drive to keep abreast of the postwar boom in commercial air transportation. In 1946, meanwhile, Congress gave CAA the added task of administering the federal-aid airport program, the first peacetime program of financial assistance aimed exclusively at development of the nation's civil airports.\n\n\n=== Formation ===\nThe approaching era of jet travel (and a series of midair collisions\u2014most notably the 1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision) prompted passage of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958.

It succeeds the Boeing 737 Next Generation (NG) and competes with the Airbus A320neo family.\nThe new series was announced in August 2011, first flown in January 2016, and certified by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in March 2017. The first 737 MAX delivered to a customer was a MAX 8 to Malindo Air, which accepted and began operating the aircraft in May 2017.\nThe 737 MAX is based on earlier 737 designs, with more efficient CFM International LEAP engines, aerodynamic changes including distinctive split-tip winglets, and airframe modifications.\nThe 737 MAX series has been offered in four variants, with 138 to 204 seats in typical two-class configuration, and a range of 3,300 to 3,850 nautical miles [nmi] (6,110 to 7,130 km; 3,800 to 4,430 mi). The 737 MAX 7, MAX 8, and MAX 9 are intended to replace the 737-700, -800, and -900 respectively, and a further-stretched 737 MAX 10 is available. However, as of February 2024, the MAX 7 and MAX 10 have not been certified, with the FAA declining to provide a timetable for approval. As of May 2024, the 737 MAX has 4,748 unfilled orders and 1,521 deliveries.\nTwo 737 MAXs have had deadly crashes: Lion Air Flight 610 in late 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in early 2019, in which 346 people died. Contributing to the accidents was the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which activated unexpectedly due to erroneous angle of attack data, and remained active because of pilot error caused by inadequate training. The aircraft was subsequently grounded worldwide from March 2019 to November 2020, with the FAA garnering criticism for being the last major authority to ground it. Investigations found Boeing did not fully inform operators about MCAS and found shortcomings in the FAA's certification process for the aircraft. The accidents and grounding cost Boeing an estimated US$20 billion in fines, compensation and legal fees as of 2020, with indirect losses of more than US$60 billion from 1,200 cancelled orders. In 2021, Boeing paid US$2.5 billion in penalties and compensation to settle the DOJ's fraud conspiracy case against the company. Further investigations revealed the FAA and Boeing had colluded on recertification test flights and attempted to cover up important information, and that the FAA had retaliated against whistleblowers. The FAA cleared the aircraft to return to service on November 18, 2020, subject to mandated design and training changes. Canadian and European authorities followed in late January 2021. By December 2021, when Chinese authorities lifted their grounding, 180 of 195 countries had cleared the 737 MAX to return to service.\nIn January 2024, the door plug blew out of an emergency-exit door on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, causing an uncontrolled decompression of the aircraft. The FAA immediately mandated a grounding and inspections of all 737 MAX 9 with a similar configuration; affected aircraft were returned to service starting at the end of that month.

In June 2010, executives postponed the decision. On December 1, 2010, Boeing competitor Airbus launched the Airbus A320neo family, which offered better fuel economy and operating efficiency than the 737, thanks to its engines: the LEAP from CFM International and the PW1000G from Pratt & Whitney. \nIn February 2011, Boeing CEO Jim McNerney said, \"We're going to do a new airplane.\" The company had been developing a new aircraft to replace the 737 as part of its Yellowstone Project. In March 2011, Boeing CFO James A. Bell told investors that the company might re-engine the 737, but later that month Boeing Commercial Airplanes President James Albaugh said that the company was not sure about that. The Airbus A320neo gathered 667 commitments at the June 2011 Paris Air Show, bringing its order backlog to 1,029 aircraft, an order record for a new commercial airliner.\nOn July 20, 2011, American Airlines, which had long bought only Boeing jets, announced an order for 460 narrowbody jets including 130 A320ceo (current engine option), 130 A320neo, and 100 737NG. Officials also said they would order 100 re-engined 737s with CFM LEAP if Boeing pursued the project.\n\n\n=== Program launch ===\n\nFaced with the record orders for Airbus and the defection of a long-time customer, on August 30, 2011, Boeing's board of directors approved the launch of the re-engined 737, which they said would meet or exceed the range of the Airbus A320neo while burning 4% less fuel. Studies for additional drag reduction were performed during 2011, including revised tail cone, natural laminar flow nacelle, and hybrid laminar flow vertical stabilizer. To focus on the re-engine project, Boeing abandoned the development of a new design under its Yellowstone Project. Firm configuration for the 737 MAX was scheduled for 2013.\nIn March 2010, the estimated cost to re-engine the 737, according to Mike Bair, Boeing Commercial Airplanes' vice president of business strategy and marketing, would be US$2\u20133 billion, including the CFM engine development. During Boeing's Q2 2011 earnings call, CFO James Bell said the development cost for the airframe only would be 10\u201315% of the cost of a new program, which was estimated at US$10\u201312 billion at the time. Bernstein Research predicted in January 2012, that this cost would be twice that of the A320neo. The MAX development cost could have been well over the internal target of US$2 billion, and closer to US$4 billion. Fuel consumption is reduced by 14% from the 737NG. Southwest Airlines was signed up as the launch customer in 2011.\nIn November 2014, McNerney said the 737 would be replaced by a new airplane by 2030\u2014probably using composite materials\u2014that would be slightly bigger and have new engines but would retain the 737's general configuration. Boeing talked about developing a clean sheet aircraft to replace the 737. The conceived aircraft was to have a fuselage similar to the 737 though slightly larger, and would make use of the advanced composite technology developed for the 787 Dreamliner. Boeing also considered a parallel development along with the 757 replacement, similar to the development of the 757 and 767 in the 1970s."

On December 8, 2015, the first 737 MAX\u2014a MAX 8 named Spirit of Renton\u2014was rolled out at the Boeing Renton Factory.\nBecause GKN could not produce the titanium honeycomb inner walls for the thrust reversers quickly enough, Boeing switched to a composite part produced by Spirit to deliver 47 MAXs per month in 2017. Spirit supplies 69% of the 737 airframe, including the fuselage, thrust reverser, engine pylons, nacelles, and wing leading edges.\nA new spar-assembly line with robotic drilling machines was expected to increase throughput by 33%. The Electroimpact automated panel assembly line sped up the wing lower-skin assembly by 35%. Boeing planned to increase its 737 MAX monthly production rate from 42 planes in 2017, to 57 planes by 2019. The new spar-assembly line is designed by Electroimpact. Electroimpact has also installed fully automated riveting machines and tooling to fasten stringers to the wing skin.\nThe rate increase strained the production and by August 2018, over 40 unfinished jets were parked in Renton, awaiting parts or engine installation, as CFM engines and Spirit fuselages were delivered late. After parked airplanes peaked at 53 at the beginning of September, Boeing reduced this by nine the following month, as deliveries rose to 61 from 29 in July and 48 in August.\nOn September 23, 2015, Boeing announced a collaboration with Comac to build a completion and delivery facility for the 737, in Zhoushan, China, the first outside the United States. This facility initially handles interior finishing only, but will subsequently be expanded to include paintwork. The first aircraft was delivered from the facility to Air China on December 15, 2018.\nThe largest part of the suppliers cost are the aerostructures at US$10\u201312 million (35-34% of the US$28.5\u221235 million total), followed by the engines at US$7\u22129 million (25-26%), systems and interiors at US$5\u20136 million each (18-17%), then avionics at US$1.5\u20132 million (5-6%).\n\n\n=== Flight testing and certification ===\n\nThe 737 MAX gained its airworthiness approval based on the 737 legacy series (first approved on December 15, 1967), as a Supplemental type certificate (STC), in lieu of a new design approval. The MAX's first flight took place on January 29, 2016, at Renton Municipal Airport, nearly 49 years after the maiden flight of the original 737-100, on April 9, 1967. The first MAX 8, 1A001, was used for aerodynamic trials: flutter testing, stability and control, and takeoff performance-data verification, before it was modified for an operator and delivered. 1A002 was used for performance and engine testing: climb and landing performance, crosswind, noise, cold weather, high altitude, fuel burn and water-ingestion. Aircraft systems including autoland were tested with 1A003. 1A004, with an airliner layout, flew function-and-reliability certification for 300 hours with a light flight-test instrumentation.\nThe 737 MAX 8 gained FAA certification on March 8, 2017, and in the same month was approved by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on March 27, 2017. After completing 2,000 test flight hours and 180-minute ETOPS testing requiring 3,000 simulated flight cycles in April 2017, CFM International notified Boeing of a possible manufacturing quality issue with low pressure turbine (LPT) discs in LEAP-1B engines. Boeing suspended 737 MAX flights on May 4, and resumed flights on May 12.\nDuring the certification process, the FAA delegated many evaluations to Boeing, allowing the manufacturer to review their own product.

                "=== Entry into service ===\n\nThe first delivery was a MAX 8, handed over to Malindo Air (a subsidiary of Lion Air) on May 16, 2017; it entered service on May 22. Norwegian Air International was the second airline to put a 737 MAX into service, when it performed its first transatlantic flight with a MAX 8 named Sir Freddie Laker on July 15, 2017, between Edinburgh Airport in Scotland and Bradley International Airport in the U.S. state of Connecticut.\nBoeing aimed for 737 MAX to match the 99.7% dispatch reliability of the 737 Next Generation (NG). Southwest Airlines, the launch customer, took delivery of its first 737 MAX on August 29, 2017. Boeing planned to deliver at least 50 to 75 aircraft in 2017, 10\u201315% of the more than five hundred 737s to be delivered in the year.\n\n\n=== Grounding and recertification ===\n\nThe 737 MAX was grounded after two fatal crashes, Lion Air Flight 610 on October 29, 2018, and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10, 2019, in which a total of 346 people died. The day following the second crash, China became the first air authority to ground the aircraft, followed the next day by Australia, the European Union, India, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and Turkey. The United States Federal Aviation Administration was one of the last to ground the aircraft, defending against groundings by issuing a Continued Airworthiness Notice to operators on March 11, garnering criticism before finally grounding it on March 13, 2019.\nContributing to the accidents was the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which activated unexpectedly due to erroneous angle of attack data, and inadequate pilot training.  Investigations found Boeing did not fully inform operators about MCAS and found shortcomings in the FAA's certification process for the aircraft. \nIn the twenty months the aircraft was grounded, Boeing redesigned the computer architecture that supported the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). As initially designed, data from just one of the aircraft's two angle-of-attack (AoA) sensors was fed into MCAS. When erroneous data from that sensor was fed into flight computers, it caused repeated uncommanded activation of MCAS, which applied nose-down trim to the horizontal stabilizer. The accident investigations revealed that the AoA sensor on Lion Air Flight 610 was miscalibrated, and the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 sensor was likely damaged by a bird strike during takeoff. Boeing was criticized for using data from just one of the two sensors, representing a single point of failure on a flight control system.\nBefore the crash of Lion Air Flight 610, pilots were not informed by Boeing of the existence of MCAS and were not required to undergo simulator training on the difference between the 737 MAX and earlier 737 versions. Boeing and the FAA would later require simulator training to demonstrate an MCAS activation to pilots. \nThe final report by the National Transportation Safety Committee of Indonesia into the Lion Air crash critisised Boeing's design and the FAA's certification process for the MCAS flight-control system and said the issues were compounded by maintenance issues and lapses by Lion Air\u2019s maintenance crews and its pilots, as well as Xtra Aerospace, a US-based company that supplied Lion Air with a replacement AoA sensor that was likely miscalibrated.\nIn the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and France\u2019s Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety identified pilot error and inadequate training by Ethiopian Airlines as critical contributing factors to the crash.\nBoeing faced legal and financial consequences, as no deliveries of the MAX could be made while the aircraft was grounded, and airlines canceled more orders than Boeing produced during this period. Boeing found foreign object debris in the fuel tanks of 35 of 50 grounded 737 MAX aircraft that were inspected and had to check the remainder of the 400 undelivered planes. The FAA curtailed Boeing's delegated authority and invited global aviation stakeholders to comment on pending changes to the aircraft and to pilot training. The FAA lifted its grounding order in 2020; all aircraft must be repaired to comply with various airworthiness directives.\nAfter being charged with fraud in connection of both crashes of the 737 MAX, Boeing settled by paying over US$2.5 billion in penalties and compensation: a criminal monetary penalty of $243.6 million, $1.77 billion in damages to airline customers, and $500 million to a fund for the families of crash victims."

The United States Federal Aviation Administration was one of the last to ground the aircraft, defending against groundings by issuing a Continued Airworthiness Notice to operators on March 11, garnering criticism before finally grounding it on March 13, 2019.\nContributing to the accidents was the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which activated unexpectedly due to erroneous angle of attack data, and inadequate pilot training.  Investigations found Boeing did not fully inform operators about MCAS and found shortcomings in the FAA's certification process for the aircraft. \nIn the twenty months the aircraft was grounded, Boeing redesigned the computer architecture that supported the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). As initially designed, data from just one of the aircraft's two angle-of-attack (AoA) sensors was fed into MCAS. When erroneous data from that sensor was fed into flight computers, it caused repeated uncommanded activation of MCAS, which applied nose-down trim to the horizontal stabilizer. The accident investigations revealed that the AoA sensor on Lion Air Flight 610 was miscalibrated, and the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 sensor was likely damaged by a bird strike during takeoff. Boeing was criticized for using data from just one of the two sensors, representing a single point of failure on a flight control system.\nBefore the crash of Lion Air Flight 610, pilots were not informed by Boeing of the existence of MCAS and were not required to undergo simulator training on the difference between the 737 MAX and earlier 737 versions. Boeing and the FAA would later require simulator training to demonstrate an MCAS activation to pilots. \nThe final report by the National Transportation Safety Committee of Indonesia into the Lion Air crash critisised Boeing's design and the FAA's certification process for the MCAS flight-control system and said the issues were compounded by maintenance issues and lapses by Lion Air\u2019s maintenance crews and its pilots, as well as Xtra Aerospace, a US-based company that supplied Lion Air with a replacement AoA sensor that was likely miscalibrated.\nIn the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and France\u2019s Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety identified pilot error and inadequate training by Ethiopian Airlines as critical contributing factors to the crash.\nBoeing faced legal and financial consequences, as no deliveries of the MAX could be made while the aircraft was grounded, and airlines canceled more orders than Boeing produced during this period. Boeing found foreign object debris in the fuel tanks of 35 of 50 grounded 737 MAX aircraft that were inspected and had to check the remainder of the 400 undelivered planes. The FAA curtailed Boeing's delegated authority and invited global aviation stakeholders to comment on pending changes to the aircraft and to pilot training. The FAA lifted its grounding order in 2020; all aircraft must be repaired to comply with various airworthiness directives.\nAfter being charged with fraud in connection of both crashes of the 737 MAX, Boeing settled by paying over US$2.5 billion in penalties and compensation: a criminal monetary penalty of $243.6 million, $1.77 billion in damages to airline customers, and $500 million to a fund for the families of crash victims."

Production of the LEAP-1B engine continued at an unchanged rate, enabling CFM to catch up its backlog within a few weeks.\nAs the 737 MAX recertification moved into 2020, Boeing suspended production from January to conserve funds and prioritize stored aircraft delivery. The 737 MAX program was the company's largest source of profit. Around 80% of the 737 production costs involve payments to parts suppliers, which may be as low as US$10 million per plane. After the announcement, Moody's cut Boeing's debt ratings in December, citing the rising costs due to the grounding and the production halt including financial support to suppliers and compensation to airlines and lessors which could lower the program's margins and cash generation for years. The rating agency also warned that the production halt would have wide and harmful impact to the whole aerospace and defense supply chain and the ramp-up would be slower than previously anticipated.

                "=== Certification of the MAX 7 and MAX 10 ===\nFollowing the recertification of the MAX 8 and MAX 9, Boeing resumed work to certify the MAX 7 and MAX 10. In March 2022, there were rumors that Boeing would request an exemption from the U.S. Aircraft Safety and Certification Reform Act of 2020, a safety reform law passed in response to the MAX crashes. The act requires airliners to be fitted with an engine-indicating and crew-alerting system (EICAS) if type certificated after December 31, 2022. Adding this feature would make the MAX 7 and MAX 10 different from other MAX variants, necessitating additional training for pilots.\nIn November 2022, Boeing announced expected delays to the certification of the MAX 7 and MAX 10, then expected in early 2023 and early 2024 respectively. In December, two proposals to exempt the MAX 7 and MAX 10 from the new EICAS requirements were considered for inclusion in a U.S. defense spending bill\u2014one a simple two-year extension to the deadline, the second an exemption for aircraft whose certification applications were submitted before the law was enacted, combined with some equipment changes\u2014but neither proposal was included in the final spending bill. \nThe U.S. Congress agreed in December 2022 on a bill allowing Boeing to certify the MAX 7 and MAX 10 without EICAS, but required that the company must install a third angle-of-attack sensor in all 737 MAX types as previously demanded by European and Canadian regulators. The company also must install a switch to disable the stick shaker, which distracted pilots during the MAX crashes. Boeing would have to retrofit these design changes to all 737 MAXs already delivered in Canada, Europe, and the U.S. within three years of MAX 10 certification. \nBoeing requested an additional exemption for the MAX 7 in December 2023. The exemption was related to a problem with the engine anti-ice system Boeing had announced in August 2023 that affected all MAX variants. Boeing had found that if pilots left the engine anti-ice system running after icing was no longer an issue, the system could heat the carbon composite inlet at the front end of the pod surrounding the engine (known as a nacelle) to break and fall off, potentially damaging the engine or fuselage. Boeing said that it was working on a fix for all MAX variants and requested that it be exempted from correcting the MAX 7 before it was allowed to enter service. Boeing withdrew its exemption request in January 2024 after being asked to do so in meetings with the U.S. Congress held after the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 accident. As of February 2024, Boeing estimated that the development, testing and validation of the fix to the anti-ice system would take an additional nine to 18 months.\nAs of February 2024, the MAX 7 and MAX 10 have not been certified, with the FAA declining to put any timetable on approval.\nThe delays have set back the fleet plans of major carriers including Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, the biggest customers for the MAX 7 and MAX 10 respectively. United also gave a rare, public rebuke of Boeing saying it was \"disappointed\" with the company and would no longer include the MAX 10 in its fleet planning, and had a meeting with Airbus to discuss securing more favorable production slots to enable the airline to introduce A321neos more rapidly to cover the delayed MAX 10s.\n\n\n== Design ==\nIn mid-2011, one design objective was matching fuel burn of the 737 MAX to that of the Airbus A320neo's 15% fuel-burn advantage. The initial 737 MAX reduction was 10\u201312%; it was later enhanced to 14.5%. The fan was widened from 61 inches (150 cm) to 69.4 in (176 cm) by raising the nose gear and placing the engine higher on the wing and further forward. The split tip winglet added 1\u20131.5% fuel burn reduction and a re-lofted tail cone another 1%. Electronically controlling the bleed air system improved efficiency. The new engine nacelle included chevrons, similar to those of the Boeing 787, which also helped to reduce engine noise."

                "=== Certification of the MAX 7 and MAX 10 ===\nFollowing the recertification of the MAX 8 and MAX 9, Boeing resumed work to certify the MAX 7 and MAX 10. In March 2022, there were rumors that Boeing would request an exemption from the U.S. Aircraft Safety and Certification Reform Act of 2020, a safety reform law passed in response to the MAX crashes. The act requires airliners to be fitted with an engine-indicating and crew-alerting system (EICAS) if type certificated after December 31, 2022. Adding this feature would make the MAX 7 and MAX 10 different from other MAX variants, necessitating additional training for pilots.\nIn November 2022, Boeing announced expected delays to the certification of the MAX 7 and MAX 10, then expected in early 2023 and early 2024 respectively. In December, two proposals to exempt the MAX 7 and MAX 10 from the new EICAS requirements were considered for inclusion in a U.S. defense spending bill\u2014one a simple two-year extension to the deadline, the second an exemption for aircraft whose certification applications were submitted before the law was enacted, combined with some equipment changes\u2014but neither proposal was included in the final spending bill. \nThe U.S. Congress agreed in December 2022 on a bill allowing Boeing to certify the MAX 7 and MAX 10 without EICAS, but required that the company must install a third angle-of-attack sensor in all 737 MAX types as previously demanded by European and Canadian regulators. The company also must install a switch to disable the stick shaker, which distracted pilots during the MAX crashes. Boeing would have to retrofit these design changes to all 737 MAXs already delivered in Canada, Europe, and the U.S. within three years of MAX 10 certification. \nBoeing requested an additional exemption for the MAX 7 in December 2023. The exemption was related to a problem with the engine anti-ice system Boeing had announced in August 2023 that affected all MAX variants. Boeing had found that if pilots left the engine anti-ice system running after icing was no longer an issue, the system could heat the carbon composite inlet at the front end of the pod surrounding the engine (known as a nacelle) to break and fall off, potentially damaging the engine or fuselage. Boeing said that it was working on a fix for all MAX variants and requested that it be exempted from correcting the MAX 7 before it was allowed to enter service. Boeing withdrew its exemption request in January 2024 after being asked to do so in meetings with the U.S. Congress held after the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 accident. As of February 2024, Boeing estimated that the development, testing and validation of the fix to the anti-ice system would take an additional nine to 18 months.\nAs of February 2024, the MAX 7 and MAX 10 have not been certified, with the FAA declining to put any timetable on approval.\nThe delays have set back the fleet plans of major carriers including Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, the biggest customers for the MAX 7 and MAX 10 respectively. United also gave a rare, public rebuke of Boeing saying it was \"disappointed\" with the company and would no longer include the MAX 10 in its fleet planning, and had a meeting with Airbus to discuss securing more favorable production slots to enable the airline to introduce A321neos more rapidly to cover the delayed MAX 10s.\n\n\n== Design ==\nIn mid-2011, one design objective was matching fuel burn of the 737 MAX to that of the Airbus A320neo's 15% fuel-burn advantage. The initial 737 MAX reduction was 10\u201312%; it was later enhanced to 14.5%. The fan was widened from 61 inches (150 cm) to 69.4 in (176 cm) by raising the nose gear and placing the engine higher on the wing and further forward. The split tip winglet added 1\u20131.5% fuel burn reduction and a re-lofted tail cone another 1%. Electronically controlling the bleed air system improved efficiency. The new engine nacelle included chevrons, similar to those of the Boeing 787, which also helped to reduce engine noise."

The new engine nacelle included chevrons, similar to those of the Boeing 787, which also helped to reduce engine noise.\n\n\n=== Aerodynamic changes ===\n\nThe 737 MAX uses a split-tip winglet, designed to reduce vortex drag, which improves fuel efficiency by maximizing lift, while staying in the same ICAO aerodrome reference code letter C gates as current Boeing 737s. It resembles a three-way hybrid of a blended winglet, wingtip fence, and raked wingtip. A split-tip wingtip was first proposed for the McDonnell Douglas MD-12, a 1990s twin-deck aircraft concept. A MAX 8 with 162 passengers on a 3,000-nautical-mile (5,600 km; 3,500 mi) flight is projected to have a 1.8% lower fuel burn than a blended winglet-equipped aircraft (like many 737NG aircraft) and 1% lower over 500 nmi (930 km; 580 mi) at Mach 0.79. The new winglet has a total height of 9 feet 6 inches (2.90 m).\nOther improvements include a re-contoured tail cone, revised auxiliary power unit inlet and exhaust, aft body vortex generator removal, and other small aerodynamic improvements.\nThe engines on the 737 MAX were also repositioned, the top of the new engine slightly higher than the top surface of the wing, resulting in a change to the aerodynamic characteristics of the airframe. Due to the aircraft's close proximity to the ground, the larger and more fuel-efficient engines did not have enough clearance. As a result, the engines were mounted higher on the wings and further forward, changing the aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft compared to the 737NG. The MCAS software-based flight control law was implemented to account for the undesirable aerodynamic changes.\n\n\n=== Structural and other changes ===\nThe 8-inch (20 cm) taller nose-gear strut maintains the same 17-inch (43 cm) ground clearance of previous 737 engine nacelles. New struts and nacelles for the heavier engines add bulk, the main landing gear and supporting structure have been reinforced, and fuselage skins are thicker in some places\u2014thus adding 6,500 pounds (2,900 kg) to the MAX 8's empty aircraft weight. To preserve fuel and payload capacity, its maximum takeoff weight is 7,000 lb (3,200 kg) heavier.\n\nRockwell Collins was selected to supply four 15.1-inch (380 mm) liquid-crystal displays (LCD), as used on the 787, for the glass cockpit to improve pilots' situation awareness and efficiency. Boeing plans no major modifications for the 737 MAX flight deck, as it wants to maintain commonality with the 737 Next Generation family. Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Jim Albaugh said in 2011, that adding more fly-by-wire control systems would be \"very minimal\". However, the 737 MAX extended spoilers are fly-by-wire controlled. Most of the systems are carried from the 737NG to allow for a short differences-training course to upgrade flight crews.\nIn addition to the Speed Trim System (STS), the automatic stabilizer control system has been enhanced to include MCAS.  Compared to STS, MCAS has greater authority and cannot be disengaged with the aft and forward column cutout switches. The center console stabilizer-trim cutout switches have been re-wired. Unlike previous versions of the 737, the automatic stabilizer trim control functions cannot be turned off while retaining electric trim switches functionality.\nMCAS was deemed necessary by Boeing to meet its internal objective of minimizing training requirements for pilots already qualified on the 737NG. MCAS was to automatically mitigate the pitch-up tendency of the new flight geometry due to the engines being located farther forward and higher than on previous 737 models. During a reassessment of the aircraft in February 2020, both FAA and EASA determined that the stability and stall characteristics of the plane would have been acceptable with or without MCAS.\nAs a production standard, the 737 MAX features the Boeing Sky Interior with overhead bins and LED lighting based on the Boeing 787's interior."

The 18-blade, woven carbon-fiber fan enables a 9:1 bypass ratio (up from 5.1:1 with the previous 24-blade titanium fan) for a 40% smaller noise footprint. The CFM56 bypass ranges from 5.1:1 to 5.5:1. The two-spool design has a low-pressure section comprising the fan and three booster stages driven by five axial turbine stages and a high-pressure section with a 10-stage axial compressor driven by a two-stage turbine. The 41:1 overall pressure ratio increased from 28:1, and advanced hot-section materials enabling higher operating temperatures permit a 15% reduction in thrust-specific fuel consumption (TSFC), along with 20% lower carbon emissions, 50% lower nitrogen-oxide emissions, though each engine weighs 849 pounds (385 kg) more at 6,129 pounds (2,780 kg).\nIn August 2011, Boeing had to choose between 66-inch (168 cm) or 68-inch (173 cm) fan diameters, necessitating landing gear changes to maintain a 17 in (43 cm) ground clearance beneath the new engines; Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive officer Jim Albaugh stated \"with a bigger fan you get more efficiency because of the bypass ratio [but also] more weight and more drag\", with more airframe changes.\nIn November 2011, Boeing selected the larger fan diameter, necessitating a 6\u20138 in (15\u201320 cm) longer nose landing gear. In May 2012, Boeing further enlarged the fan to 69.4 in (176 cm), paired with a smaller engine core within minor design changes before the mid-2013 final configuration.\nThe nacelle features chevrons for noise reduction like the 787.

One of the reasons is the production and assembly process taking longer than expected. Additionally, there may have been technical or regulatory issues that needed to be addressed before the aircraft could be certified for commercial operation.\n\nIn response to these delays, launch operator Southwest Airlines adjusted their orders by taking early delivery of their MAX 8 orders to make up for the delay of the MAX 7. This decision was likely made to ensure that Southwest could still expand their fleet and meet their operational needs despite the delays in the MAX 7 program.

                "=== 737 MAX 8 ===\n\nThe first variant developed in the 737 MAX series, the MAX 8 replaces the 737-800 with a longer fuselage than the MAX 7. In 2016, Boeing planned to improve its range from 3,515 nautical miles (6,510 km; 4,045 mi) to 3,610 nmi (6,690 km; 4,150 mi) after 2021. On July 23, 2013, Boeing completed the firm configuration for the 737 MAX 8. The MAX 8 has a lower empty weight and higher maximum takeoff weight than the A320neo. During a test flight conducted for Aviation Week, while cruising at a true airspeed of 449 knots (517 mph; 832 km/h) and a weight of 140,500 pounds (63,700 kg), at a lower than optimal altitude (FL350 vs. the preferred FL390) and with an \"unusually far forward\" center of gravity, the test aircraft consumed 4,460 lb (2,020 kg) of fuel per hour.\nThe Boeing 737 MAX 8 completed its first flight test in La Paz, Bolivia. The 13,300-foot (4,100 m) altitude at El Alto International Airport tested the MAX's capability to take off and land at high altitudes. Its first commercial flight was operated by Malindo Air on May 22, 2017, between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore as Flight OD803. In early 2017, a new MAX 8  was valued at $52.85 million, rising to below $54.5 million by mid 2018.\n\n\n==== 737 MAX 200 ====\n\nIn September 2014, Boeing launched a high-density version of the 737 MAX 8, the 737 MAX 200 or 737-8-200, named for seating for up to 200 passengers in a single-class high-density configuration with slimline seats; an extra pair of exit doors is required because of the higher passenger capacity. Boeing states that this version would be 20% more cost-efficient per seat than current 737 models and would be the most efficient narrow-body on the market when delivered, including 5% lower operating costs than the 737 MAX 8. Three of eight service trolleys are removed to accommodate more passenger space. An order with Ryanair for 100 aircraft was finalized in December 2014.\nIn mid-November 2018, the first of then 135 ordered by Ryanair rolled out, in a 197-seat configuration. It was first flown from Renton on January 13, 2019, and was due to enter service in April 2019, with another four MAX 200s expected later in 2019, though certification and deliveries were deferred while the MAX was grounded. In November 2019, Ryanair informed its pilots that, due to an unspecified design issue with the additional over-wing exit doors, it did not expect to receive any MAX 200s until late April or early May 2020. In 2020, at the height of the COVID travel slump, Ryanair renegotiated its order and purchased an additional 75 MAX 200 aircraft at one-third of the list price.\nThe high-density variant was certified by the FAA on March 31, 2021. Ryanair took delivery of its first MAX 200 in June 2021. Besides launch customer Ryanair, other customers include International Airlines Group and low-cost airlines Akasa Air of India, Allegiant Air of the US, Arajet of the Dominican Republic and Vietnam's VietJet.\n\n\n==== Proposed 737-8ERX ====\nAirlines have been shown a 737-8ERX concept based on the 737 MAX 8 with a higher 194,700-pound (88.3 t) maximum take-off weight and a longer range of 4,000 nautical miles (7,400 km; 4,600 mi) using the wings, landing gear, and central section from the MAX 9.

The range of this aircraft would be closer to the Airbus A321LR, although with a smaller 150 seat capacity.\n\n\n=== 737 MAX 9 ===\n\nThe 737 MAX 9 replaces the 737-900 and has a longer fuselage than the MAX 8. In 2016, Boeing planned to improve its range from 3,510 nautical miles (6,500 km; 4,040 mi) to 3,605 nmi (6,676 km; 4,149 mi) after 2021. Lion Air was the launch customer with an order for 201 in February 2012. It made its roll-out on March 7, 2017, and first flight on April 13, 2017; it took off from Renton Municipal Airport and landed at Boeing Field after a 2 hr 42 min flight. It was presented at the 2017 Paris Air Show.\nBoeing 737 MAX 9 flight tests were scheduled to run through 2017, with 30% of the -8 tests repeated; aircraft 1D001 was used for auto-land, avionics, flutter, and mostly stability-and-control trials, while 1D002 was used for environment control system testing. It was certified by February 2018. Asian low-cost carrier Lion Air Group took delivery of the first MAX 9 on March 21, 2018, before entering service with Thai Lion Air. As the competing Airbus A321neo attracts more orders, the sale value of a 737 MAX 9 is the same as a 2018 MAX 8 at $53 million (~$63.4 million in 2023).\n\n\n=== 737 MAX 10 ===\n\nLoyal customers, such as Korean Air and United Airlines, pressed Boeing to develop a variant larger than the MAX 9 in order to compete with the Airbus A321neo, of which Boeing revealed studies in early 2016. As the Airbus A321neo had outsold the MAX 9 five-to-one, the proposed MAX 10 included a larger engine, stronger wings, and telescoping landing gear in mid-2016. In September 2016, it was reported that the variant would be simpler and lower-risk, with a modest stretch of 6\u20137 feet (1.83\u20132.13 m) for a length of 143\u2013144 ft (43.6\u201343.9 m), seating 12\u201318 more passengers for 192\u2013198 in a dual-class layout or 226-232 for a single class, needing an uprated 31,000 pounds-force (140 kN) LEAP-1B that could be available by 2019 or 2020, and would likely require a landing-gear modification to move the rotation point slightly aft.\nIn October 2016, Boeing's board of directors granted authority to offer the stretched variant with two extra fuselage sections forward and aft with a 3,100 nautical miles (5,700 km; 3,600 mi) range, reduced from the 3,300 nmi (6,100 km; 3,800 mi) range of the MAX 9. In early 2017, Boeing showed a 66 inches (1.7 m) stretch to 143 ft (44 m), enabling seating for 230 in a single class or 189 in two-class capacity, compared to 193 in two-class seating for the A321neo. The modest stretch of the MAX 10 enables the aircraft to retain the existing wing, and the Leap 1B engine from the MAX 9 with a trailing-link main landing gear as the only major change. Boeing 737 MAX Vice President and General Manager Keith Leverkuhn said the design had to be frozen in 2018, for a 2020 introduction.\nBoeing hopes that 737 operators and 737 MAX customers like United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Alaska Airlines, Air Canada, Lion Air, and Chinese airlines will be interested in the new variant. Boeing predicts a 5% lower trip cost and seat cost compared to the A321neo. Air Lease Corporation wants it a year sooner; its CEO John Pleuger stated, \"It would have been better to get the first airplane in March 2019, but I don't think that's possible.\" AerCap CEO Aengus Kelly is cautious and said the -9 and -10 \"will cannibalize each other\"."

It was presented at the 2017 Paris Air Show.\nBoeing 737 MAX 9 flight tests were scheduled to run through 2017, with 30% of the -8 tests repeated; aircraft 1D001 was used for auto-land, avionics, flutter, and mostly stability-and-control trials, while 1D002 was used for environment control system testing. It was certified by February 2018. Asian low-cost carrier Lion Air Group took delivery of the first MAX 9 on March 21, 2018, before entering service with Thai Lion Air. As the competing Airbus A321neo attracts more orders, the sale value of a 737 MAX 9 is the same as a 2018 MAX 8 at $53 million (~$63.4 million in 2023).\n\n\n=== 737 MAX 10 ===\n\nLoyal customers, such as Korean Air and United Airlines, pressed Boeing to develop a variant larger than the MAX 9 in order to compete with the Airbus A321neo, of which Boeing revealed studies in early 2016. As the Airbus A321neo had outsold the MAX 9 five-to-one, the proposed MAX 10 included a larger engine, stronger wings, and telescoping landing gear in mid-2016. In September 2016, it was reported that the variant would be simpler and lower-risk, with a modest stretch of 6\u20137 feet (1.83\u20132.13 m) for a length of 143\u2013144 ft (43.6\u201343.9 m), seating 12\u201318 more passengers for 192\u2013198 in a dual-class layout or 226-232 for a single class, needing an uprated 31,000 pounds-force (140 kN) LEAP-1B that could be available by 2019 or 2020, and would likely require a landing-gear modification to move the rotation point slightly aft.\nIn October 2016, Boeing's board of directors granted authority to offer the stretched variant with two extra fuselage sections forward and aft with a 3,100 nautical miles (5,700 km; 3,600 mi) range, reduced from the 3,300 nmi (6,100 km; 3,800 mi) range of the MAX 9. In early 2017, Boeing showed a 66 inches (1.7 m) stretch to 143 ft (44 m), enabling seating for 230 in a single class or 189 in two-class capacity, compared to 193 in two-class seating for the A321neo. The modest stretch of the MAX 10 enables the aircraft to retain the existing wing, and the Leap 1B engine from the MAX 9 with a trailing-link main landing gear as the only major change. Boeing 737 MAX Vice President and General Manager Keith Leverkuhn said the design had to be frozen in 2018, for a 2020 introduction.\nBoeing hopes that 737 operators and 737 MAX customers like United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Alaska Airlines, Air Canada, Lion Air, and Chinese airlines will be interested in the new variant. Boeing predicts a 5% lower trip cost and seat cost compared to the A321neo. Air Lease Corporation wants it a year sooner; its CEO John Pleuger stated, \"It would have been better to get the first airplane in March 2019, but I don't think that's possible.\" AerCap CEO Aengus Kelly is cautious and said the -9 and -10 \"will cannibalize each other\"."

            "reference_answer": "Boeing faced several challenges and considerations in developing the 737 MAX 10 variant. One of the main challenges was to compete with the Airbus A321neo, which had outsold the MAX 9. To address this, Boeing had to develop a larger variant with a modest stretch of 6\u20137 feet, allowing for seating of 192\u2013198 passengers in a dual-class layout or 226-232 in a single class. This required modifications such as a larger engine, stronger wings, and telescoping landing gear.\n\nIn terms of engine requirements, the MAX 10 needed an uprated 31,000 pounds-force LEAP-1B engine, which was expected to be available by 2019 or 2020. Additionally, the aircraft design had to be frozen in 2018 for a planned introduction in 2020, highlighting the timeline constraints Boeing faced in developing the variant.\n\nBoeing predicted a 5% lower trip cost and seat cost for the MAX 10 compared to the A321neo, aiming to attract 737 operators and MAX customers. Key industry players, such as United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Alaska Airlines, Air Canada, Lion Air, and Chinese airlines, were expected to be interested in the new variant. However, there were mixed reactions from industry players, with Air Lease Corporation wanting the aircraft a year sooner and AerCap CEO expressing caution about potential cannibalization between the MAX 9 and MAX 10 variants. Overall, Boeing had to carefully navigate these challenges and considerations to successfully develop and introduce the 737 MAX 10 variant.",

The cause of the crash was initially unclear, though the aircraft's vertical speed after takeoff was reported to be unstable. Evidence retrieved on the crash site suggests, that at the time of the crash, the aircraft was configured to dive, similar to Lion Air Flight 610. The similarity of the physical and flight data evidence from the accidents led to the global 737 MAX groundings beginning on the day of the second accident."

            "reference_answer": "The Boeing 737 MAX aircraft had a significant number of orders and deliveries since its inception. By January 2019, there were 5,011 firm orders from 78 identified customers, with Southwest Airlines, flydubai, and Lion Air being the top three customers. However, following the groundings in March 2019 due to the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, Boeing suspended all deliveries, reduced production, and eventually suspended production in January 2020 to conserve cash. At the time of the grounding, there were 4,636 unfilled orders valued at an estimated $600 billion.\n\nTo address the backlog of unfilled orders, Boeing worked to clear the remaining inventory of 335 MAX aircraft by the end of 2023. They produced over 450 MAX aircraft awaiting delivery, with half expected to be delivered in 2021 and the majority in 2022. By November 30, 2020, at the time of the ungrounding, the unfilled orders stood at 4,039 aircraft. In November 2021, Boeing received 72 firm orders from a new customer, Akasa Air, and in late January 2022, they estimated that most of the remaining inventory would be delivered by the end of 2023. Additionally, in December 2022, the 1000th 737 MAX was delivered, indicating progress in addressing the backlog of orders. As of May 2024, the 737 MAX has 4,748 unfilled orders and 1,521 deliveries, showing continued efforts to fulfill the remaining orders.",

            "reference_answer": "The incidents involving Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 both involved Boeing 737 MAX aircraft experiencing critical issues shortly after takeoff. In the case of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, the aircraft crashed due to an unstable vertical speed after takeoff, leading to a configuration that caused the plane to dive. This incident was similar to the crash of Lion Air Flight 610, which prompted the global grounding of the 737 MAX fleet.\n\nOn the other hand, Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 experienced an uncontrolled decompression caused by a door plug blowing out shortly after takeoff. This incident did not result in any fatalities or significant injuries, but it raised concerns about the safety of the 737 MAX aircraft, particularly those with rear mid-cabin exit doors and door plugs.\n\nThe factors that led to the grounding of the 737 MAX fleet in both cases were related to safety concerns and potential design flaws. In the case of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, the similarities to the Lion Air crash raised alarms about the aircraft's flight control system and potential issues with the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). The grounding was necessary to investigate and address these concerns to ensure the safety of passengers and crew.\n\nSimilarly, the incident involving Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 highlighted a specific issue with door plugs on the 737 MAX aircraft, leading to the grounding and inspection of similar aircraft in the fleet to prevent any further incidents. The discovery of loose door plug bolts on some aircraft further emphasized the need for thorough inspections and corrective actions to address potential safety risks.\n\nIn both cases, the grounding of the 737 MAX fleet was a precautionary measure taken to ensure the safety of passengers and prevent any further incidents related to the identified issues. The investigations and corrective actions taken following these incidents were crucial in restoring confidence in the aircraft and ensuring its safe operation in the future.",

                "The Cessna 172 Skyhawk is an American four-seat, single-engine, high wing, fixed-wing aircraft made by the Cessna Aircraft Company. First flown in 1955, more 172s have been built than any other aircraft. It was developed from the 1948 Cessna 170 but with tricycle landing gear rather than conventional landing gear. The Skyhawk name was originally used for a trim package, but was later applied to all standard-production 172 aircraft, while some upgraded versions were marketed as the Cutlass, Powermatic, and Hawk XP. The aircraft was also produced under license in France by Reims Aviation, which marketed upgraded versions as the Reims Rocket.\nMeasured by its longevity and popularity, the Cessna 172 is the most successful aircraft in history. Cessna delivered the first production model in 1956, and as of 2015, the company and its partners had built more than 44,000 units. With a break from 1986\u201396, the aircraft remains in production today.\nA light general aviation airplane, the Skyhawk's main competitors throughout its lifetime have been the Beechcraft Musketeer and Grumman American AA-5 series (neither currently in production), the Piper PA-28 Cherokee, and, more recently, the Diamond DA40 Star and Cirrus SR20.\n\n\n== Design and development ==\nThe Cessna 172 started as a tricycle landing gear variant of the taildragger Cessna 170, with a basic level of standard equipment. In January 1955, Cessna flew an improved variant of the Cessna 170, a Continental O-300-A-powered Cessna 170C with larger elevators and a more angular tailfin. Although the variant was tested and certified, Cessna decided to modify it with a tricycle landing gear, and the modified Cessna 170C flew again on June 12, 1955. To reduce the time and cost of certification, the type was added to the Cessna 170 type certificate as the Model 172. Later, the 172 was given its own type certificate. The 172 became an overnight sales success, and over 1,400 were built in 1956, its first full year of production.\nEarly 172s were similar in appearance to the 170s, with the same straight aft fuselage and tall landing gear legs, although the 172 had a straight tailfin while the 170 had a rounded fin and rudder. In 1960, the 172A incorporated revised landing gear and the swept-back tailfin, which is still in use today.\nThe final aesthetic development, found in the 1963 172D and all later 172 models, was a lowered rear deck allowing an aft window. Cessna advertised this added rear visibility as \"Omni-Vision\".\nProduction halted in the mid-1980s, but resumed in 1996 with the 160 hp (120 kW) Cessna 172R Skyhawk. Cessna supplemented this in 1998 with the 180 hp (135 kW) Cessna 172S Skyhawk SP.\n\n\n=== Modifications ===\nThe Cessna 172 may be modified via a wide array of supplemental type certificates (STCs), including increased engine power and higher gross weights. Available STC engine modifications increase power from 180 to 210 hp (134 to 157 kW), add constant-speed propellers, or allow the use of automobile gasoline. Other modifications include additional fuel tank capacity in the wing tips, added baggage compartment tanks, added wheel pants to reduce drag, or enhanced landing and takeoff performance and safety with a STOL kit. The 172 has also been equipped with the 180 hp (134 kW) fuel injected Superior Air Parts Vantage engine.\n\n\n== Operational history ==\n\n\n=== World records ===\nFrom December 4, 1958, to February 7, 1959, Robert Timm and John Cook set the world record for (refueled) flight endurance in a used Cessna 172, registration number N9172B. They took off from McCarran Field (now Harry Reid International Airport) in Las Vegas, Nevada, and landed back at McCarran Field after 64 days, 22 hours, 19 minutes and 5 seconds in a flight covering an estimated 150,000 miles (240,000 km), over 6 times further than flying around the world at the equator. The flight was part of a fund-raising effort for the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund. The aircraft is now on display at the airport.\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\nCessna has historically used model years similar to U.S. auto manufacturers, with sales of new models typically starting a few months prior to the actual calendar year."

The 172 also featured a redesigned tail similar to the experimental 170C, \"Para-Lift\" flaps, and a maximum gross weight of 2,200 lb (998 kg) while retaining the 170B's 145 hp (108 kW) Continental O-300-A six-cylinder, air-cooled engine.  The 1957 and 1959 model years brought only minor changes, while 1959 introduced a new cowling for improved engine cooling.  The prototype 172, c/n 612, was modified from 170 c/n 27053, which previously served as the prototype of the 170B.  A total of 3,757 were constructed over the four model years; 1,178 (1956), 1,041 (1957), 750 (1958), 788 (1959).\n\n172A\n\n1960 model year with a swept-back vertical tail and rudder and powered by a 145 hp (108 kW) O-300-C engine.  It was also the first 172 to be certified for floatplane operation.  994 built.\n\n172B\n1961 model year with shorter landing gear, engine mounts lengthened by three inches (76 mm), a reshaped cowling, a pointed propeller spinner, and an increased gross weight of 2,250 lb (1,021 kg).

The increased power resulted in an increase in optimal cruise from 130 mph (209 km/h) true airspeed (TAS) to 131 mph (211 km/h) TAS.  There was no change in the sea level rate of climb at 645 ft (197 m) per minute.  Starting with this model, the standard and deluxe Skyhawk models were no longer powered by different engines.  The 172I also introduced the first standard \"T\" instrument arrangement.  649 built.\n\n172J\n\nFor 1968, Cessna planned to replace the 172 with a newly designed aircraft called the 172J, featuring the same general configuration but with a more sloping windshield, a strutless cantilever wing, a more stylish interior, and various other improvements. A single 172J prototype, registered N3765C (c/n 660), was built.

The 1970 model year featured fiberglass, downward-shaped, conical camber wingtips and optional fully articulated seats.  2,055 built for both model years, plus 50 by Reims as the F172K.\n\n172L\nIntroduced for the 1971 model year with tapered, tubular steel landing gear legs replacing the original flat spring steel legs, increasing landing gear width by 12 in (30 cm).  The new landing gear was lighter, but required aerodynamic fairings to maintain the same speed and climb performance as experienced with the flat steel design.  172L also had a nose-mounted landing light, a bonded baggage door, and optional cabin skylights.  The 1972 model year introduced a plastic fairing between the dorsal fin and vertical fin to introduce a greater family resemblance to the 182's vertical fin.  1972 also introduced a reduced-diameter propeller, bonded cabin doors, and improved instrument panel controls.  1,535 built for both model years, plus 100 by Reims as the F172L.\n\n172M\n\nIntroduced for the 1973 model year with a \"Camber-Lift\" wing with a drooped leading edge for improved low-speed handling, a key-locking baggage door, and new lighting switches.  The 1974 model year introduced the Skyhawk II, which was sold alongside the baseline 172M and Skyhawk models with higher standard equipment, including a second nav/comm radio, an ADF and transponder, a larger baggage compartment, and nose-mounted dual landing lights.  1975 introduced inertia-reel shoulder harnesses and an improved instrument panel and door seals.  Beginning in 1976, Cessna stopped marketing the aircraft as the 172 and began exclusively using the \"Skyhawk\" designation.

Among other changes, the fuel and other small gauges were relocated to the left side for improved pilot readability compared with the earlier 172 panel designs.  6,826 built; 4,926 (1973\u201375) and 1,900 (1976), plus 610 by Reims as the F172M.\n\n172N Skyhawk/100\n\n1977 model year powered by a 160 horsepower (119 kW) Lycoming O-320-H2AD engine designed to run on 100-octane fuel (hence the \"Skyhawk/100\" name), whereas all previous engines used 80/87 fuel.  Other changes included pre-select flap control and optional rudder trim.  The 1978 model year brought a 28-volt electrical system to replace the previous 14-volt system as well as optional air conditioning.  The 1979 model year increased the flap-extension speed to 110 knots (204 km/h).  6,425 total built; 1,725 (1977), 1,725 (1978), 1,850 (1979), and 1,125 (1980), plus 525 by Reims as the F172N.\n\n172O\nThere was no \"O\" model 172, to avoid confusion with the number zero.\n\n172P Skyhawk P\n\nIntroduced for the 1981 model year with a Lycoming O-320-D2J engine replacing the O-320-H2AD of the 172N, which had proven unreliable.  Other changes included a decreased maximum flap deflection from 40 degrees to 30 to allow a gross weight increase from 2,300 lb (1,043 kg) to 2,400 lb (1,089 kg).  A 62 US gal (235 L) wet wing and air conditioning were optional.  The 1982 model year moved the landing lights from the nose to the wing to increase bulb life, while 1983 added some minor soundproofing improvements and thicker windows.  1984 introduced a second door latch pin, a thicker windshield and side windows, additional avionics capacity, and low-vacuum warning lights.  2,664 total built; 1,052 (1981), 724 (1982), 319 (1983), 179 (1984), 256 (1985), and 134 (1986), plus 215 by Reims as the F172P.  Following the end of 172P production in 1986, Cessna ceased production of the Skyhawk for ten years.\n\n172Q Cutlass\nIntroduced for the 1983 model year, the 172Q was given the name \"Cutlass\" to create an affiliation with the 172RG Cutlass RG, although it was actually a 172P with a Lycoming O-360-A4N engine of 180 horsepower (134 kW).  The aircraft had a gross weight of 2,550 lb (1,157 kg) and an optimal cruise speed of 122 knots (226 km/h) compared to the 172P's cruise speed of 120 knots (222 km/h) on 20 hp (15 kW) less.  It had a useful load that was about 100 lb (45 kg) more than the Skyhawk P and a rate of climb that was actually 20 feet (6 m) per minute lower, due to the higher gross weight.  The Cutlass II was offered as a deluxe model of the 172Q, as was the Cutlass II/Nav-Pac with IFR equipment.  The 172Q was produced alongside the 172P for the 1983 and 1984 model years before being discontinued.  Sources disagree on the exact number of 172Q aircraft built, and the construction numbers listed on the Federal Aviation Administration type certificate overlap with those of the 1983 and 1984 172P."

Among other changes, the fuel and other small gauges were relocated to the left side for improved pilot readability compared with the earlier 172 panel designs.  6,826 built; 4,926 (1973\u201375) and 1,900 (1976), plus 610 by Reims as the F172M.\n\n172N Skyhawk/100\n\n1977 model year powered by a 160 horsepower (119 kW) Lycoming O-320-H2AD engine designed to run on 100-octane fuel (hence the \"Skyhawk/100\" name), whereas all previous engines used 80/87 fuel.  Other changes included pre-select flap control and optional rudder trim.  The 1978 model year brought a 28-volt electrical system to replace the previous 14-volt system as well as optional air conditioning.  The 1979 model year increased the flap-extension speed to 110 knots (204 km/h).  6,425 total built; 1,725 (1977), 1,725 (1978), 1,850 (1979), and 1,125 (1980), plus 525 by Reims as the F172N.\n\n172O\nThere was no \"O\" model 172, to avoid confusion with the number zero.\n\n172P Skyhawk P\n\nIntroduced for the 1981 model year with a Lycoming O-320-D2J engine replacing the O-320-H2AD of the 172N, which had proven unreliable.  Other changes included a decreased maximum flap deflection from 40 degrees to 30 to allow a gross weight increase from 2,300 lb (1,043 kg) to 2,400 lb (1,089 kg).  A 62 US gal (235 L) wet wing and air conditioning were optional.  The 1982 model year moved the landing lights from the nose to the wing to increase bulb life, while 1983 added some minor soundproofing improvements and thicker windows.  1984 introduced a second door latch pin, a thicker windshield and side windows, additional avionics capacity, and low-vacuum warning lights.  2,664 total built; 1,052 (1981), 724 (1982), 319 (1983), 179 (1984), 256 (1985), and 134 (1986), plus 215 by Reims as the F172P.  Following the end of 172P production in 1986, Cessna ceased production of the Skyhawk for ten years.\n\n172Q Cutlass\nIntroduced for the 1983 model year, the 172Q was given the name \"Cutlass\" to create an affiliation with the 172RG Cutlass RG, although it was actually a 172P with a Lycoming O-360-A4N engine of 180 horsepower (134 kW).  The aircraft had a gross weight of 2,550 lb (1,157 kg) and an optimal cruise speed of 122 knots (226 km/h) compared to the 172P's cruise speed of 120 knots (222 km/h) on 20 hp (15 kW) less.  It had a useful load that was about 100 lb (45 kg) more than the Skyhawk P and a rate of climb that was actually 20 feet (6 m) per minute lower, due to the higher gross weight.  The Cutlass II was offered as a deluxe model of the 172Q, as was the Cutlass II/Nav-Pac with IFR equipment.  The 172Q was produced alongside the 172P for the 1983 and 1984 model years before being discontinued.  Sources disagree on the exact number of 172Q aircraft built, and the construction numbers listed on the Federal Aviation Administration type certificate overlap with those of the 1983 and 1984 172P."

This is the first Cessna 172 to have a factory-fitted fuel-injected engine.\nThe 172R's maximum takeoff weight is 2,450 lb (1,111 kg). This model year introduced many improvements, including a new interior with soundproofing, an all new multi-level ventilation system, a standard four point intercom, contoured, energy absorbing, 26g front seats with vertical and reclining adjustments and inertia reel harnesses.\n\n172S Skyhawk SP\n\nThe Cessna 172S was introduced in 1998 and is powered by a Lycoming IO-360-L2A producing 180 horsepower (134 kW). The maximum engine rpm was increased from 2,400 rpm to 2,700 rpm resulting in a 20 hp (15 kW) increase over the \"R\" model. As a result, the maximum takeoff weight was increased to 2,550 lb (1,157 kg). This model is marketed under the name Skyhawk SP, although the Type Certification data sheet specifies it is a 172S.\nThe 172S is built primarily for the private owner-operator and is, in its later years, offered with the Garmin G1000 avionics package and leather seats as standard equipment.\nAs of 2009, the 172S model was the only Skyhawk model in production.\n\n\n=== Variants under 175 type certificate ===\nAs the Cessna 175 Skylark had gained a reputation for poor engine reliability, Cessna attempted to regain sales by rebranding the aircraft as a variant of the 172.\n\nP172D Powermatic\nThe 175 Skylark was rebranded for the 1963 model year as the P172D Powermatic, continuing where the Skylark left off at 175C.  It was powered by a geared 175 hp (130 kW) Continental GO-300-E driving a constant-speed propeller, increasing cruise speed by 11 mph (18 km/h) over the standard 172D. It differed from the 175C in that it had a cut-down rear fuselage with an \"Omni-Vision\" rear window and an increased horizontal stabilizer span. A deluxe version was marketed as the Skyhawk Powermatic with a slightly increased top speed.  Despite the rebranding, sales did not meet expectations, and the 175 type was discontinued for the civilian market after the 1963 model year.  65 were built, plus 3 by Reims as the FP172D.\n\nR172E\n\nAlthough the 175 type was discontinued for the civilian market, Cessna continued to produce the aircraft for the United States Armed Forces as the T-41 Mescalero.  Introduced in 1967, the R172E was built in T-41B, T-41C, and T-41D variants for the US Army, USAF Academy, and US Military Aid Program, respectively.  As the T-41B, the R172E was powered by a fuel-injected 210 hp (157 kW) Continental IO-360-D or -DE driving a constant-speed propeller, and featured a 28V electrical system, jettisonable doors, an openable right front window, a 6.00x6 nose wheel tire and military avionics, but no baggage door. The T-41C was similar to the T-41B, but had a 14V electrical system, a fixed-pitch propeller, civilian avionics, and no rear seats. The T-41D featured a 28V electrical system, four seats, corrosion-proofing, reinforced flaps and ailerons, a baggage door, and provisions for wing-mounted pylons. 255 (T-41B), 45 (T-41C), and 34 (T-41D) built."

Initial retail price in 2014 was $435,000 (~$551,508 in 2023). The model has a top speed of 131 kn (243 km/h) and burns 3 U.S. gallons (11 L; 2.5 imp gal) per hour less fuel than the standard 172. As a result, the model has an 885 nmi (1,639 km) range, an increase of more than 38% over the standard 172. This model is a development of the proposed and then cancelled Skyhawk TD.

Diesel engines cost more than twice as much to manufacture as gasoline engines do and although their fuel efficiency gains back some of that investment, if the complete aircraft package is too pricey, the debt service will eat up any savings, making a new aircraft not just unattractive, but unaffordable.

In July 2011, Bye Energy, whose name had been changed to Beyond Aviation, announced the prototype had commenced taxi tests on 22 July 2011 and a first flight would follow soon.

In July 2013, the 172TD model was canceled due to Thielert's bankruptcy.

Paella is regarded as one of the community's identifying symbols. It is one of the best-known dishes in Spanish cuisine.\nThe dish takes its name from the wide, shallow traditional pan used to cook the dish on an open fire, paella being the word for a frying pan in Valencian language. As a dish, it may have ancient roots, but in its modern form, it is traced back to the mid-19th century, in the rural area around the Albufera lagoon adjacent to the city of Valencia, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.\nPaella valenciana is the traditional paella of the Valencia region, believed to be the original recipe, and consists of round-grain rice, bajoqueta and tavella (varieties of green beans), rabbit, chicken, sometimes duck, and garrof\u00f3 (a variety of lima or butter bean), cooked in olive oil and chicken broth. The dish is sometimes seasoned with whole rosemary branches. Traditionally, the yellow color comes from saffron, but turmeric and Calendula can be used as substitutes. Artichoke hearts and stems may be used as seasonal ingredients. Most paella cooks use bomba rice, but a cultivar known as senia is also used in the Valencia region.\nPaella de marisco (seafood paella) replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables, while paella mixta (mixed paella) combines meat from livestock, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans, with the traditional rice.\nOther popular local variations of paella are cooked throughout the Mediterranean area, the rest of Spain, and internationally.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Possible origins ===\n\nMuslims in Al-Andalus began rice cultivation around the 10th century. Consequently, eastern Iberian Peninsula locals often made casseroles of rice, fish, and spices for family gatherings and religious feasts, thus establishing the custom of eating rice in Spain. This led to rice becoming a staple by the 15th century. Afterward, it became customary for cooks to combine rice with vegetables, beans, and dry cod, providing an acceptable meal for Lent. Along Spain's Mediterranean coast, rice was predominantly eaten with fish.\nSpanish food historian Lourdes March notes that the dish \"symbolizes the union and heritage of two important cultures, the Roman, which gives us the utensil and the Arab which brought us the basic food of humanity for centuries: rice.\"\n\n\n=== Naming, etymology and paellera ===\n\nPaella is a Valencian word that means frying pan, from which the dish gets its name. Valencian speakers use the word paella for all pans, including the traditional shallow pan used for cooking the homonym dish. The pan is made of polished or coated steel with two side handles.\nIn many regions of Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries, the term paellera may be used for the traditional pan, while paella is reserved for the rice dish prepared in it. Both paella and paellera are correct terms for the pan.\nAccording to the etymologist Joan Coromines, the Catalan word paella derives from the Old French word paelle for frying pan, which in turn comes from the Latin word patella for pan; he thinks that otherwise the word should be padella, as inter-vowel -d- dropping is not typical of Old Catalan.\nThe word paella is also related to paila used in many Latin American countries. Paila in Latin American Spanish refers to a variety of cookware resembling metal and clay pans, which are also used for both cooking and serving.\nThe Latin root patella from which paella derives is also akin to the modern French po\u00eale, the Italian padella, and the Old Spanish padilla.\nSome claim that the word paella comes from the Arabic \u0628\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u064a\u064e\u0627, pronounced baqaayya, meaning \"leftovers.\" This claim is based on the 8th-century custom in which Moorish kings' servants would take home the rice, chicken, and vegetables their employers left at the end of the meal. It has been said, however, that a problem with this etymology is that the word paella is not attested until six centuries after Moorish Valencia was conquered by James I."

Workers would gather what was available to them around the rice fields. This often included tomatoes, onions, and snails.

                "The history of Mexico City stretches back to its founding ca. 1325 CE as the Mexica city-state of Tenochtitlan, which evolved into the senior partner of the Aztec Triple Alliance that dominated central Mexico immediately prior to the Spanish conquest of 1519\u20131521. At its height, Tenochtitlan had enormous temples and palaces, a huge ceremonial center, and residences of political, religious, military, and merchants. Its population was estimated at least 100,000 and perhaps as high as 200,000 in 1519 when the Spaniards first saw it. During the final stage of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Spanish forces and their indigenous allies besieged and razed Tenochtitlan. Because it was strategically and politically important, invader Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s founded the Spanish colonial capital of Mexico City on its ruins, becoming the center of Spanish colonial power. Following Mexican independence from Spain in 1821, Mexico City became the capital of the sovereign nation, remaining its largest and most important city to the present day.  \n\nBeginning in 1521, the Aztec ceremonial and political center was rebuilt as the city's main square, the Plaza Mayor, usually called the Z\u00f3calo. Some of the oldest structures in Mexico City date from the early conquest era. Many colonial-era buildings remain standing and have been re-purposed as government buildings and museums.  As the seats of the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the Archbishopric of New Spain, Mexico City was the center not only of political and religious institutions but also of Mexico's economic activity and the residence of Spanish colonial elites (1521\u20131821).  Great merchant houses linked to Spain were located here, and the economic elites whose properties were often elsewhere in New Spain also lived in the capital. The concentration of mansions and palaces in what is now the Mexico City historic center led it to be nicknamed the \"City of Palaces\", a sobriquet often attributed, perhaps erroneously, to great savant Alexander von Humboldt.  It was also a major educational center: the University of Mexico was founded in 1553 as part of the complex of the Plaza Mayor but is now located in the south of the capital.  Many religious institutions for the education of the sons of Spanish elites were also based in the capital. Mexico City had the colony's largest concentration of those of Spanish heritage (both Iberian-born peninsulares and American-born criollos), as well as the largest concentration of mixed race casta population in the colony. Many indigenous people also lived in the capital, outside the central core, concentrated in their own section and governed by an indigenous town council.\nPost-independence, U.S. forces captured Mexico City during the Mexican\u2013American War, and the city saw violence during the Reform War and the French Intervention as well as the Mexican Revolution. At the beginning of the 20th century, the city's population stood at about 500,000. The city's history in the 20th and 21st centuries has been marked by explosive population growth and its accompanying problems. The city center deteriorated. The government has had problems keeping up with basic services, but the building of the Mexico City Metro has alleviated some major transportation problems. Smog became a serious problem as the shanty towns evolved, formed by the poor of the country migrating to the city. The 1985 Mexico City earthquake caused significant damage to the center of the city. In the 2000s, businessman and philanthropist Carlos Slim created a foundation to revitalize the historic center as well as sites near the Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe. In 2016, the Mexican government initiated the process of greater autonomy from the federal government, creating the Ciudad de M\u00e9xico or CDMX.\n\n\n== The Aztec city-state of Tenochtitlan ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\n\t\n\nThe Aztecs were one of the last of the Nahuatl-speaking peoples who migrated to this part of the Valley of Mexico after the fall of the Toltec Empire. Existing inhabitants resisted their presence, but the Aztecs established a city on a small island on the western side of Lake Texcoco. The Aztecs themselves had a story about how their city was founded after their principal god, Huitzilopochtli, led them to the island. According to the story, the god indicated their new home with a sign, an eagle perched on a nopal cactus with a snake in its beak. This image appears in Codex Mendoza, one early post-conquest manuscript of many Aztec codices or pictorial texts, and since Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, the image is in the center of the Mexican flag."

Many indigenous people also lived in the capital, outside the central core, concentrated in their own section and governed by an indigenous town council.\nPost-independence, U.S. forces captured Mexico City during the Mexican\u2013American War, and the city saw violence during the Reform War and the French Intervention as well as the Mexican Revolution. At the beginning of the 20th century, the city's population stood at about 500,000. The city's history in the 20th and 21st centuries has been marked by explosive population growth and its accompanying problems. The city center deteriorated. The government has had problems keeping up with basic services, but the building of the Mexico City Metro has alleviated some major transportation problems. Smog became a serious problem as the shanty towns evolved, formed by the poor of the country migrating to the city. The 1985 Mexico City earthquake caused significant damage to the center of the city. In the 2000s, businessman and philanthropist Carlos Slim created a foundation to revitalize the historic center as well as sites near the Basilica of the Virgin of Guadalupe. In 2016, the Mexican government initiated the process of greater autonomy from the federal government, creating the Ciudad de M\u00e9xico or CDMX.\n\n\n== The Aztec city-state of Tenochtitlan ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\n\t\n\nThe Aztecs were one of the last of the Nahuatl-speaking peoples who migrated to this part of the Valley of Mexico after the fall of the Toltec Empire.

A portion of the population left and went to the nearby island of Tlatelolco, establishing a monarchy there, with their first ruler being Acamapitzin.  Shortly thereafter, the people of Tenochtitlan had their own monarchy. The two cities became rivals. Eventually, Tenochtitlan conquered Tlatelolco eliminating its rulers and incorporated the city into Tenochtitlan and was named Mexico which some natives didn't like.\nAt its height, just before the Spanish arrived, Tenochtitlan was the center of the vast Aztec Empire, stretching from the Atlantic to Pacific coasts and south towards the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and Oaxaca. With a vast income of tribute, Tenochtitlan grew to become one of the largest and richest urban areas in the world at that time. The city had services and infrastructure that was unheard of in the rest of the world: potable water brought in by aqueducts, drainage systems and wide, paved streets. Their markets boasted of products from nearly every part of Mesoamerica.\n\nTenochtitlan roughly correlates with the historic center of modern Mexico City. During the pre-Hispanic era, the city developed in a planned fashion, with streets and canals aligned with the cardinal directions, leading to orderly square blocks.\nThe island that the city was founded on was divided into four calpullis or neighborhoods that were divided by the main north\u2013south roads leading to Tepeyac and Iztapalapa respectively and the west\u2013east road that lead to Tacuba and to a dike into the lake, respectively. The calpullis were named Cuepopan, Atzacualco, Moyotla and Zoquipan, which had subdivisions and a \"tecpan\" or district council for each one. The intersection of these roads was the center of the city and of the Aztec world. Here were the main temple, the palaces of the tlatoani or emperors, palaces of nobles such as the \"House of the Demons\" and the \"House of the Flowers\".  Also located here were the two most renowned Aztec schools: the Telpuchcalli for secular studies and the Calmecac for priestly training.\n\n\n== Spanish conquest and reconstruction of city ==\n\n\n=== Conquest of Tenochtitlan ===\n\nAfter landing near the modern-day city of Veracruz, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s heard about the great city and also learned of long-standing rivalries and grievances against it. Although Cort\u00e9s came to Mexico with a very small contingent of Spaniards, he was able to persuade many of the other native peoples to help him destroy Tenochtitlan.\nFor a time, these allied peoples made use of the arrival of the European in the hopes of creating a world freed of Aztec domination. Spanish objective, however, was that they themselves would benefit from the destruction of Tenochtitlan, making the native peoples not free, but rather more subservient to the Spaniards than they were to the Aztecs.\nMoctezuma, then-chief of the Aztecs, had been receiving accounts of the Europeans' arrival since their ships (reported as towers or small mountains on the eastern sea) arrived in the Yucat\u00e1n then Veracruz. First-hand accounts from Spaniards indicate that the Aztec were under some impression that Cort\u00e9s was the god Quetzalcoatl. According to these reports, the direction of the ships' arrival and because of the Spaniards light skin, long beards and short hair fit a prophecy about this god's return. This motivated Moctezuma to send gifts to the Spaniards when they arrived in Veracruz."

Carlos de Sig\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora gives the day 18 July 1327, but at least three other codices (Azcatitlan, Mexicanus and Mendoza) placed the time of its founding in the year 1325, and los Anales de Tlatelolco adds the day-sign \"1 Zipaktli,\" correlated to the beginning of summer solstice on 20 June.\n\n\n=== Tenochtitlan at its height ===\n\nThirteen years after the founding of Tenochtitlan, the population of the islet had grown and there was internal strife.  A portion of the population left and went to the nearby island of Tlatelolco, establishing a monarchy there, with their first ruler being Acamapitzin.  Shortly thereafter, the people of Tenochtitlan had their own monarchy. The two cities became rivals. Eventually, Tenochtitlan conquered Tlatelolco eliminating its rulers and incorporated the city into Tenochtitlan and was named Mexico which some natives didn't like.\nAt its height, just before the Spanish arrived, Tenochtitlan was the center of the vast Aztec Empire, stretching from the Atlantic to Pacific coasts and south towards the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and Oaxaca. With a vast income of tribute, Tenochtitlan grew to become one of the largest and richest urban areas in the world at that time. The city had services and infrastructure that was unheard of in the rest of the world: potable water brought in by aqueducts, drainage systems and wide, paved streets. Their markets boasted of products from nearly every part of Mesoamerica.\n\nTenochtitlan roughly correlates with the historic center of modern Mexico City. During the pre-Hispanic era, the city developed in a planned fashion, with streets and canals aligned with the cardinal directions, leading to orderly square blocks.\nThe island that the city was founded on was divided into four calpullis or neighborhoods that were divided by the main north\u2013south roads leading to Tepeyac and Iztapalapa respectively and the west\u2013east road that lead to Tacuba and to a dike into the lake, respectively. The calpullis were named Cuepopan, Atzacualco, Moyotla and Zoquipan, which had subdivisions and a \"tecpan\" or district council for each one. The intersection of these roads was the center of the city and of the Aztec world. Here were the main temple, the palaces of the tlatoani or emperors, palaces of nobles such as the \"House of the Demons\" and the \"House of the Flowers\".  Also located here were the two most renowned Aztec schools: the Telpuchcalli for secular studies and the Calmecac for priestly training.\n\n\n== Spanish conquest and reconstruction of city ==\n\n\n=== Conquest of Tenochtitlan ===\n\nAfter landing near the modern-day city of Veracruz, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s heard about the great city and also learned of long-standing rivalries and grievances against it. Although Cort\u00e9s came to Mexico with a very small contingent of Spaniards, he was able to persuade many of the other native peoples to help him destroy Tenochtitlan.\nFor a time, these allied peoples made use of the arrival of the European in the hopes of creating a world freed of Aztec domination. Spanish objective, however, was that they themselves would benefit from the destruction of Tenochtitlan, making the native peoples not free, but rather more subservient to the Spaniards than they were to the Aztecs.\nMoctezuma, then-chief of the Aztecs, had been receiving accounts of the Europeans' arrival since their ships (reported as towers or small mountains on the eastern sea) arrived in the Yucat\u00e1n then Veracruz. First-hand accounts from Spaniards indicate that the Aztec were under some impression that Cort\u00e9s was the god Quetzalcoatl. According to these reports, the direction of the ships' arrival and because of the Spaniards light skin, long beards and short hair fit a prophecy about this god's return. This motivated Moctezuma to send gifts to the Spaniards when they arrived in Veracruz."

            "reference_answer": "The internal strife and rivalry between Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco began thirteen years after the founding of Tenochtitlan, when a portion of the population left and established a monarchy on the nearby island of Tlatelolco, with their first ruler being Acamapitzin. This led to the two cities becoming rivals. Eventually, Tenochtitlan conquered Tlatelolco, eliminating its rulers and incorporating the city into Tenochtitlan, which was then named Mexico.\n\nIn terms of governance and leadership, Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco had their own monarchies. Tlatelolco established a monarchy with Acamapitzin as their first ruler, while Tenochtitlan also had their own monarchy. The rivalry between the two cities eventually led to conflict, with Tenochtitlan conquering Tlatelolco. This conquest resulted in Tenochtitlan becoming the dominant city and incorporating Tlatelolco into its own governance structure.\n\nOverall, the internal strife and rivalry between Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco showcased the power struggles and competition for dominance that existed between different city-states in the region during that time period. The eventual conquest of Tlatelolco by Tenochtitlan solidified the latter's position as the center of the Aztec Empire.",

It was established as a ciudad de espa\u00f1oles (city of Spaniards) and initially kept the remnants of its prehispanic place name, being called \"Mexico-Tenochtitlan\". No longer the seat of Aztec power, the Spaniards allowed two areas to be ruled through Nahua governors (gobernadores) and town councils (cabildos), separate from the Spanish city council.  San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco became the mechanism for the crown to rule through indigenous intermediaries, particularly important in the Spanish capital since it also had a significant indigenous population.  San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco were not called by the Nahuatl term for polity, altepetl, but rather \"partes\" or \"parcialidades\" of Mexico City, with their new place names having a Christian saint's name preceding the prehispanic designation, in typical colonial fashion. The structure in these two indigenous-ruled sections of the capital were on the same pattern of indigenous towns elsewhere in central Mexico.  In the sixteenth century, these indigenous political structures mobilized tribute and labor rendered to the Spanish capital. Even though prehispanic Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco was built on an island in the middle of the major lake system, they had political power over holdings on the mainland, a standard pattern of scattered rather than compact settlement and rule. These mainland holdings or estancias rendered tribute and labor in the prehispanic period; in the colonial period this pattern continued during the early colonial period, but during the later period (ca. 1650\u20131821), the pattern broke down and estancias were separated.\n\nThe city grew with buildings all near the same height and with the same terraced roofs (azoteas), with only the tower and cross of the convent of San Francisco peaking up from above it all. This profile was due to royal decree. Even the new cathedral being built had limitations as to its height.  Near the end of the 16th century however, there was a proliferation of churches with bell towers, leading to a zigzag profile of the city, which was then later modified by church cupolas. For centuries afterward, this profile remained constant with only the continuous building of the main Cathedral making any change in the skyline. In the 19th century, the tallest structures were all churches. In addition to the Cathedral, there were the bell towers and cupolas of Santa Teresa la Antigua, the College of Saints Peter and Paul and the chapel of San Felipe Neri as landmarks.\nThe new city inherited much of the old city's look, oriented to the four cardinal directions with both canals and streets to move people and goods.  However, the canals had already begun to shrink due to efforts to make the land streets wider.The first public building was called Las Atarazanas, where the brigantines used to lay siege to Tenochititlan were kept, at a place called San L\u00e1zaro.

Spaniards had not maintained the Aztec drainage system, which included a major dike. Major floods in Mexico City were recorded in 1555, 1580, 1604, and 1607, indigenous labor was diverted when crown officials undertook a major project to divert water via a drainage system, known as the Desag\u00fce. In 1607, 4,500 Indigenous people were drafted to build the 8-mile-long combination drainage ditch and tunnel and 1608, the work was continued with 3,000. Flooding was controlled in the short term, and in subsequent years the Desag\u00fce infrastructure was not maintained.  In 1629, rains inundated the capital and flood waters remained in the capital for the next few years. Viceroy Don Rodrigo Pacheco, 3rd Marquis of Cerralvo, the Mexico City council (cabildo), secular and regular clergy, and elite Spanish residents of Mexico City combined efforts to provide immediate relief, and taxes and diversion of indigenous labor to construction of the Desag\u00fce aimed at dealing with the long-term problem of flooding. A number of Spaniards moved to dry land to the nearby settlement of Coyoac\u00e1n (now part of Mexico City), increasing the displacement of indigenous ownership of land there. In 1630, there was a serious proposal to move the capital to dry land rather than continue dealing with constant flooding.  Elite Mexico City property owners and the city council opposed the plan, since they would incur huge real estate losses. There was another major push to deal with flooding, but the pattern of neglect of the desag\u00fce infrastructure and subsequent inundation of the capital recurred, with flooding in 1645, 1674, 1691, 1707, 1714, 1724, 1747 and 1763.

In the latter half of the 18th century the populated area reached eastward to the lakeshore, which then was just beyond the now Circuito Interior and the La Merced Market. To the south began to appear houses in an area now called Colonia Doctores. To the west, following what is now Avenida Chapultepec towards the Ciudadela, now the National Library, near Metro Balderas. To the north past Tlatelolco and to the south to Topacioa and the now Calzada de la Viga.\nAfter independence, there were continued attempts to complete the drainage project, with activity in the early 1830s.  During the U.S. invasion of the valley of Mexico, its army made a study of the problem, but the withdrawal of U.S. forces with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo put an end to that attempt.  During the Liberal Reform of the 1850s, there was a revived plan for solving the problem, settling on a plan proposed by Francisco de Garay for a series of open canals to channel water out of the capital and through the mountains. As public health became more of a concern during the Porfiriato, the stench, uncleanliness, and perceived danger from the capital's water renewed efforts to implement the drainage project. D\u00edaz created a commission to oversee work, but the project went further than merely controlling rainwater and stagnation and sought the expansion of water rights under its control for a growing population.

A figure for Tenochtitlan tributaries in 1562 is 12,971. The estimates of the European population in Mexico City is also imprecise, with figures coming from a variety of sources.  In 1525 there were 150 households occupied by Spaniards, with the European population increasing steadily during the entire colonial period.  The highest estimate for the colonial era is by Alexander von Humboldt, who estimated ca. 1802 that there were 67,500 whites in Mexico City.\nThe size of Mexico City's population and its demographic contours have been enduring questions for crown officials as well as modern scholars.  There were major epidemics that affected the population, starting with the smallpox epidemic of 1520 that was a factor in the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire, but there were other major epidemics throughout the colonial period.  There were estimates taken in the late seventeenth century, with the largest and most detailed census mandated by Viceroy Revillagigedo in 1790. In 1689, there was an estimate of 57,000 residents. An estimate for 1753 based on a partial census mandated by the Audiencia put the population at 70,000. In the period between 1689 and 1753, there were at least nine epidemics. The Revillagigedo census of 1790 counts 112,926 residents, a significant increase. This might be due to migration to the city accelerating.  An 1811 census done by the \u2018'Juzgado de Polic\u00eda'\u2019 put the number even higher, at 168,811, which might well reflect displacement from the countryside from the insurgency of Miguel Hidalgo and his successors. The census of 1813 done by the city government (Ayuntamiento) shows a significant decrease to 123,907, perhaps showing the return of short-term migrants to their home communities following the waning of the insurgency, but also possibly \"fevers\" that affected the population.\n\n\n==== Racial composition ====\nAlthough Mexico City was designated the capital of the viceroyalty, it still had a significant non-white population throughout the colonial period.

The total number of Mexico City residents counted in 1793 was 104,760 (which excludes 8,166 officials) and in the intendancy as a whole 1,043,223, excluding 2,299 officials.

The highest concentration of Spaniards was around the traza, the central sector of the city where the civil and religious institutions were based and where there was the highest concentration of wealthy merchants.

Castas appear as residents in all sectors of the capital.\n\n\n=== Nobility in Mexico City \u2013 \"City of Palaces\" ===\n\nThe concept of nobility transferred to New Spain in a way not seen in other parts of the Americas. A noble title here did not mean one exercised great political power as one's power was limited even if the accumulation of wealth was not. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, most of those who had titles gained them after their families had accumulated wealth over several generations. Many of these nobles made their money outside of the capital at large haciendas or in mining but spent their fortunes in the capital. Those who made their money in the city were usually wholesalers from lower social backgrounds. The merchant-financiers became almost as prominent as the landowners because they were the decisive element of the city's economy. Many of the leading figures were of Spanish origin, although their principal economic interests and family connections were within New Spain. For example, the Andalusian, Pedro Romero de Terreros, who became Count of Regla in 1768, made his money in silver mining at Real del Monte, near Pachuca, from 1742. This blending of wealth of landowners and merchant-financiers led to a blending of traditional and modern practices. Matrimony and personal ties continued to be the principal means of solidifying business interests. Nephews, other relatives and friends formed broad networks of interest over a wide geographical area from the capital cities into the countryside and through the span of economic activities.  The landowners, however, remained in a slightly higher social position because their livelihoods stemmed from their close working arrangement with the colonial state.\nSome landowners' holdings were almost kingdoms. Between the 1730s and the 19th century, the Marquis of San Miguel de Aguayo had amassed properties that combined were about two-thirds the size of Portugal, or 19,000,000 acres (77,000 km2). These estates were centered in the modern-day state of Durango, and their specialty was sheep-raising. Meat from their stock supplied Mexico City and wool was sold to various textile workshops. The Aguayos left these estates in the hands of administrators, backed by armed guards to ward off indigenous attack, to live off the revenues in Mexico City, where they possessed four palatial residences. Their title had been awarded in 1682, but the land purchases by the family dated from the 1580s.\nThe concept of nobility in Mexico was not political but rather a very conservative Spanish social one, based on proving the worthiness of the family, not the individual. For an individual to receive a noble title, he would have to prove his family's bloodline as well as their loyalty to God and king for a number of generations prior. Such a quest was costly but once a title was secured the costs did not stop there.\nNobles in New Spain had to continually reinforce their devotion to both God and king.  To show their piety, most nobles donated temporal goods to the Roman Catholic Church, by building churches, funding missionary activities and charities. Sometimes nobles would also hold religious office or give one or more children (usually daughters) to a religious vocation but this was relatively rare. Demonstrating loyalty to king meant paying taxes to maintain their titles, sometimes purchasing military rank as well.\nTheir last duty was to maintain a certain show of luxury. It was not a case of \"keeping up with the Jones'\", but rather a requirement of the position.  Families that could not keep up a certain level of luxury were scolded by royal officers as not honoring their title. Such conspicuous consumption manifested itself in dress, jewels, furniture and especially in the building of mansions and palaces.\nThe pressure to build the most opulent residence possible reached its height in the last half of the 18th century. Nobles leveled old buildings, using their Aztec stones and Spanish bricks to build more fashionable Baroque and Neo classic style mansions.

Nobles leveled old buildings, using their Aztec stones and Spanish bricks to build more fashionable Baroque and Neo classic style mansions. Many of the most costly were on what was called San Francisco street (now Madero street) and near the Alameda Central.  Near the Alameda were the homes of the Marquis of Guardiola, of the Borda family and the house of the Marquis of Prado Alegre as well as the home of the Counts of the Valley of Orizaba who covered the entire fa\u00e7ade with talavera tiles from Puebla. On San Francisco Street, the most famous house was that of the Marquis of Jaral. It was a former convent that the marquis converted into a replica of the royal palace of Palermo for his daughter and her Sicilian husband. Later it was the home of Felix Calleja and then Agust\u00edn de Iturbide, who accepted the crown of Mexico from its balcony. Today it is known as the Palace of Iturbide.\nMost of these palaces still remain in the city center. Their abundance led Charles Joseph Latrobe, a man of high standing in Australia, to name Mexico City the \"city of palaces\" in his book \"The rambler in Mexico.\" This moniker is often erroneously attributed to the famous scientist and savant Alexander von Humboldt, who traveled extensively through New Spain and wrote The Political Essay of the Kingdom of New Spain, published in 1804.\nSuch need for pomp made for an extreme social class difference. Alexander von Humboldt reported that foreigners were often horrified at the differences between how the nobles lived and the misery of the common people. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, there was a strong desire among nobles to transform colonial absolutism to something like an autonomous, constitutional state. More specifically, they looked for more power in the rural regions outside of Mexico City where their holdings were. There was an experience in such decentralization in September 1808, when tensions between the metropolis and the other regions of New Spain were high.  Then regional elites used this situation to subvert the colonial government in the city, turning to popular mobilization against the elite of Mexico City when they failed to subvert the colonial militia.\n\n\n=== The urban poor in Mexico City ===\n\nMexico City also has a long tradition of urban poverty, while at the same time being home to the largest concentration of wealthy people in New Spain. There were institutions designed both to control the urban poor, but also aid them, created by private donors, the Church, and the crown.  The establishment of the Nacional Monte de Piedad, the pawnshop still in operation in modern Mexico City, allowed urban dwellers who had any property at all to pawn access to interest-free, small-scale credit. It was set up in 1777, by the Count of Regla, who had made a fortune in silver mining, and the pawnshop continues to operate as a national institution in the twenty-first century, with its headquarters still right off the Z\u00f3calo in Mexico City with branches in many other places in Mexico.  The Count of Regla's donation is an example of private philanthropy in the late colonial period. A much earlier example was the endowment that conqueror Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s gave to establish the Hospital de Jes\u00fas, which is the only venue in Mexico City that has a bust of the conqueror.  Another eighteenth-century example of private philanthropy that then became a crown institution was the \u2018'Hospicio de Pobres'\u2019, the Mexico City Poor House, founded in 1774 with funds of a single ecclesiastical donor, Choirmaster of the Cathedral, Fernando Ortiz Cort\u00e9s, who became its first director. That institution lasted about a century, until 1871, going from a poor house or work house for adults to mainly being an orphanage for abandoned street children. The Mexico City Poor House was partially supported by another eighteenth-century institution, the Royal Lottery. There was also a foundling home established in 1767, the \u2018'Casa de Cuna'\u2019 (house of the cradle)."

Today it is known as the Palace of Iturbide.\nMost of these palaces still remain in the city center. Their abundance led Charles Joseph Latrobe, a man of high standing in Australia, to name Mexico City the \"city of palaces\" in his book \"The rambler in Mexico.\" This moniker is often erroneously attributed to the famous scientist and savant Alexander von Humboldt, who traveled extensively through New Spain and wrote The Political Essay of the Kingdom of New Spain, published in 1804.\nSuch need for pomp made for an extreme social class difference. Alexander von Humboldt reported that foreigners were often horrified at the differences between how the nobles lived and the misery of the common people. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, there was a strong desire among nobles to transform colonial absolutism to something like an autonomous, constitutional state. More specifically, they looked for more power in the rural regions outside of Mexico City where their holdings were. There was an experience in such decentralization in September 1808, when tensions between the metropolis and the other regions of New Spain were high.  Then regional elites used this situation to subvert the colonial government in the city, turning to popular mobilization against the elite of Mexico City when they failed to subvert the colonial militia.\n\n\n=== The urban poor in Mexico City ===\n\nMexico City also has a long tradition of urban poverty, while at the same time being home to the largest concentration of wealthy people in New Spain. There were institutions designed both to control the urban poor, but also aid them, created by private donors, the Church, and the crown.  The establishment of the Nacional Monte de Piedad, the pawnshop still in operation in modern Mexico City, allowed urban dwellers who had any property at all to pawn access to interest-free, small-scale credit. It was set up in 1777, by the Count of Regla, who had made a fortune in silver mining, and the pawnshop continues to operate as a national institution in the twenty-first century, with its headquarters still right off the Z\u00f3calo in Mexico City with branches in many other places in Mexico.  The Count of Regla's donation is an example of private philanthropy in the late colonial period. A much earlier example was the endowment that conqueror Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s gave to establish the Hospital de Jes\u00fas, which is the only venue in Mexico City that has a bust of the conqueror.  Another eighteenth-century example of private philanthropy that then became a crown institution was the \u2018'Hospicio de Pobres'\u2019, the Mexico City Poor House, founded in 1774 with funds of a single ecclesiastical donor, Choirmaster of the Cathedral, Fernando Ortiz Cort\u00e9s, who became its first director. That institution lasted about a century, until 1871, going from a poor house or work house for adults to mainly being an orphanage for abandoned street children. The Mexico City Poor House was partially supported by another eighteenth-century institution, the Royal Lottery. There was also a foundling home established in 1767, the \u2018'Casa de Cuna'\u2019 (house of the cradle)."

While the nobility in Mexico City also did not like the absolute colonial system, their goal was limited representation and autonomy within the Spanish empire.  They decided to make their stand in 1820, after the rural insurgency had been going on for several years, choosing Colonel Agust\u00edn de Iturbide to push their interests militarily.  Iturbide had fought against Morelos between 1813 and 1816. However, between 1816 and 1820, Iturbide was becoming sympathetic to the idea of some degree of independence for Mexico. In 1821, Iturbide was the supreme commander of the royalist forces and had put down all but one of the major rebels, Vicente Guerrero. Iturbide decided to meet with Guerrero, after becoming convinced that independence was the only real course for Mexico. However, Iturbide's idea was a Mexican monarchy with ties to King Ferdinand VII of Spain.\nAfter switching sides, Iturbide chose to pressure the colonial government by repeating Hidalgo's strategy of closing in on the city from the surrounding area.  Iturbide was able to succeed where Hidalgo had not because the Spanish-born commanders in the city supported Iturbide's idea of limited autonomy, and many the royalist forces were in the field battling insurgents like Guerrero. Iturbide's Army of the Three Guarantees (Independence, Union, Religion) entered Mexico City on 21 September 1821. On the following 27 September, Mexico was declared independent.\nThe Mexico City nobles sought to preserve as much of the old as possible, and garnered the support of a substantial section of the royalist army to recreate central power. Their objective was to halt the devolution of power to the regions outside the city and the lower echelons of society. Shortly after his triumphant entrance into the city, Iturbide declared what is now known as the First Mexican Empire, with himself as emperor, from the palace that now bears his name. The coronation of Agust\u00edn as emperor and his wife Ana Mar\u00eda as empress took place amid much pomp and circumstance on 21 July 1822 at the Cathedral of Mexico City. The Archbishop Fonte presided over the anointment of the Emperor who following Napoleon's example, crowned himself.\nFollowing his coronation, the new empire was politically and financially unstable. Iturbide was accused of taking too much power for himself, and his main rival was Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna. In the spring of 1823, Iturbide offered his abdication, which was accepted by his political opponents and then left the country for Europe. \nMexico was then declared a republic. The republican constitution of 1824 established Mexico City as the nation's capital. Unrest followed for the next several decades, as different factions fought for control of Mexico."

                "Women were also arrested for desertion at higher rates than men, mainly when the women were in their twenties.  Arrest records indicate that many of these women had provincial origins and the women migrated to the capital leaving a spouse behind. Their arrests for desertion indicates their spouses wanted them reunited with the family. In trials the women often stated that nonsupport or domestic abuse was the reason they deserted.\nMen also deserted their wives, but were arrested in smaller numbers (perhaps not reflecting the real extent of their desertion); these men abandoning their families did so between the ages of 20 and 49. In their trials, many men cited their inability to support their families as the reason for desertion.  The insecurity of employment of the lower classes meant that there was continuous stress on the urban poor families, particularly for unskilled or semi-skilled workers, although artisans also abandoned their families.\n\n\n== Independence to the Mexican Revolution ==\n\n\n=== Mexican Independence and Iturbide ===\n\nWhen rebellion against Spanish rule broke out, interests outside of Mexico City would be represented by Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos and others. While the nobility in Mexico City also did not like the absolute colonial system, their goal was limited representation and autonomy within the Spanish empire.  They decided to make their stand in 1820, after the rural insurgency had been going on for several years, choosing Colonel Agust\u00edn de Iturbide to push their interests militarily.  Iturbide had fought against Morelos between 1813 and 1816. However, between 1816 and 1820, Iturbide was becoming sympathetic to the idea of some degree of independence for Mexico. In 1821, Iturbide was the supreme commander of the royalist forces and had put down all but one of the major rebels, Vicente Guerrero. Iturbide decided to meet with Guerrero, after becoming convinced that independence was the only real course for Mexico. However, Iturbide's idea was a Mexican monarchy with ties to King Ferdinand VII of Spain.\nAfter switching sides, Iturbide chose to pressure the colonial government by repeating Hidalgo's strategy of closing in on the city from the surrounding area.  Iturbide was able to succeed where Hidalgo had not because the Spanish-born commanders in the city supported Iturbide's idea of limited autonomy, and many the royalist forces were in the field battling insurgents like Guerrero. Iturbide's Army of the Three Guarantees (Independence, Union, Religion) entered Mexico City on 21 September 1821. On the following 27 September, Mexico was declared independent.\nThe Mexico City nobles sought to preserve as much of the old as possible, and garnered the support of a substantial section of the royalist army to recreate central power. Their objective was to halt the devolution of power to the regions outside the city and the lower echelons of society. Shortly after his triumphant entrance into the city, Iturbide declared what is now known as the First Mexican Empire, with himself as emperor, from the palace that now bears his name. The coronation of Agust\u00edn as emperor and his wife Ana Mar\u00eda as empress took place amid much pomp and circumstance on 21 July 1822 at the Cathedral of Mexico City. The Archbishop Fonte presided over the anointment of the Emperor who following Napoleon's example, crowned himself.\nFollowing his coronation, the new empire was politically and financially unstable. Iturbide was accused of taking too much power for himself, and his main rival was Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna. In the spring of 1823, Iturbide offered his abdication, which was accepted by his political opponents and then left the country for Europe. \nMexico was then declared a republic. The republican constitution of 1824 established Mexico City as the nation's capital. Unrest followed for the next several decades, as different factions fought for control of Mexico."

            "reference_answer": "The events leading up to Mexican independence were characterized by a struggle between different factions with varying goals. While the rural insurgency led by figures like Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos aimed for complete independence from Spain, the nobility in Mexico City sought limited representation and autonomy within the Spanish empire. In 1820, Colonel Agust\u00edn de Iturbide emerged as a key figure representing the interests of the Mexico City nobility. Initially a royalist commander, Iturbide eventually switched sides and aligned himself with the independence movement, leading to the establishment of the First Mexican Empire.\n\nIturbide's Army of the Three Guarantees successfully entered Mexico City in 1821, and he declared Mexico independent on September 27 of that year. However, Iturbide's rule quickly became unstable due to various factors. He was accused of centralizing power and faced opposition from figures like Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna. In response to mounting pressure, Iturbide offered his abdication in 1823 and left the country for Europe.\n\nFollowing Iturbide's departure, Mexico was declared a republic in 1824. The republican constitution established Mexico City as the capital, but unrest and power struggles continued for several decades as different factions vied for control of the country. Factors contributing to the instability of Iturbide's rule and the transition to a republic included accusations of excessive centralization of power, opposition from political rivals, and the broader societal and economic challenges facing the newly independent nation.",

                "=== Mexican Revolution's impact ===\n\nBy the early 20th century, Mexico City was becoming a modern city, with gas and electric lighting, streetcars, and other modern amenities. However, the regime concentrated resources and wealth in the hands of a few people. The majority of the nation languished in poverty. Social injustice led to nationwide revolts, and ultimately the Mexican Revolution (1910\u20131917). The city was not untouched by the revolution. Battles were fought on its streets, and thousands of displaced villagers became refugees in the city. During the revolution, the city was briefly taken over by the famous revolutionaries Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa and Emiliano Zapata.  While most of the Mexican Revolution was not fought within the city, one major episode of this era was. La decena tr\u00e1gica (\"The Ten Tragic Days\") was a series of events leading to a coup d'\u00e9tat in Mexico City between 9 and 22 February 1913 against President Francisco I. Madero and his vice president, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez. After deposing President Porfirio D\u00edaz and taking power in 1911, Mexicans expected Madero to make widespread changes in government but were surprised and disappointed to find Madero following many of the same policies and employing the same personnel as the D\u00edaz government. This eventually resulted in revolts against the Madero regime. Madero's fear of these revolts led him to commission Victoriano Huerta as chief general of the Federal Army. Huerta was effective in putting down rebellions, but had ambitions that Madero was blind to.  Military success gave Huerta power, and he saw an opportunity to make himself dictator.  La decena tr\u00e1gica began when military academy cadets quartered in Tacubaya revolted and began an attack against the National Palace. Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez returned to the Palace to address the crisis, calling in reserves from other military academies and the forces of Felipe \u00c1ngeles in Cuernavaca to assist in defense. Meanwhile, Huerta convinced Madero to allow him to take over defense of the National Palace. Huerta betrayed Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez forcing Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez to sign resignations. On the night of 22 February, Huerta ordered Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez to be transferred to the Lecumberri prison, supposedly to be held for transfer to exile. Before the car reached the prison, it was pulled over by armed men and Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez were shot and killed.\n\n\n== 20th century to present ==\n\n\n=== Loss of democracy and recovery ===\n\nMexico City lost its democratically elected mayor and legislature/city council in 1928, which left its urban middle class and workers without legislative redress. The mayor was appointed by the President of Mexico.  Residents of the densely populated capital became dependent on the newly formed Party of National Revolution (PNR) to dress its concerns.  During the L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas presidency (1934\u201340), the government reduced spending in the capital, leaving infrastructure, such as water, sewage, lighting, without resources. C\u00e1rdenas did not implement rent control or aid urban renters, and in 1938\u201339, renters attempted to gain advantage by organizing rent strikes. The middle class and the urban poor joined in the attempt. Not until the electoral reforms of the 1990s was the mayoral elections restored.  In 1997 Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas won the position.\n\n\n=== Historic commemorations ===\nIn the historic center of Mexico City, the Plutarco El\u00edas Calles administration (1924\u201328) began placing colonial-style tiles on street corners \"on each street that has some history or legend that merits remembrance by means of their old names.\" This was part of the government's aim to shape public memory in the city, particularly of the Revolution.  Many street names were changed to commemorate the deeds of revolutionary heroes, including Francisco Madero, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez, whose democratically elected government was overthrown by military coup in 1913.\n\n\n=== Growth of the city ===\n\nIn 1900, the population of Mexico City was about 500,000. By the end of the 19th century, the perimeter of the city had noticeably grown again and by 1929, the boundaries lost any sense of regularity. The city had grown to reach Tacuba, Nextengo, Popotla, east of now Metro San L\u00e1zaro and Metro Tasque\u00f1a, Miguel \u00c1ngel de Quevedo to the south and Lomas de Chapultepec and Azcapotzalco to the west and north as the last of the lake dried up.

Much of what makes the campus culturally significant is its huge murals that decorate the facades of many of the buildings.  These murals were done by Diego Rivera, David Siqueiros and others, with themes relating to Mexican history and identity.\n\nThe 1968 Olympic Games brought about the construction of large sporting facilities such as the Palacio de los Deportes (Sports Palace), the Vel\u00f3dromo Ol\u00edmpico and the 24 buildings of the Olympic Village. \n\n \n\nThe construction of the Mexico City Metro was not ready in time for the 1968 Olympics, but in 1969, Line 1, the \"Pink Line\" the underground rapid transit system of the city, was inaugurated by President Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz. The subway system was a huge infrastructure project, designed to be mass transit for those in Mexico City without cars.  There had been proposals for a subway system dating back decades, but political forces in favor of car owners (middle class and elites) blocked the plans for underground mass transit. The subway system allows for movement of large numbers of people to increasingly far flung areas of the city. When the Ciudad Universitaria opened, which relocated UNAM to the south of the city, there was no metro line.\nExplosive growth in the population of the city started from the 1960s, with the population overflowing the boundaries of the Federal District into neighboring state of Mexico, especially to the north, northwest and northeast. Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to 8,831,079. Under relentless growth, Mexico City had lost its charm by the 1970s, when the government could barely keep up with services. Mexico City was choking in smog and pollution. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shanty towns that extended for many miles.\nMexico City is still the cultural, economic, and industrial center for the nation. With a metropolitan-area population approaching 20 million, roughly equivalent to the entire state of Texas, it is a magnet of growth. People in large numbers still migrate from rural areas to the city in search of work and the other economic. Many of these immigrants settle illegally in the urban fringe with the hope that the government will eventually provide public services. The provision of water and wastewater service for the growing population of Mexico City is the problem air pollution was in the 1970s and 1980s. Such growth rates and patterns mean substandard potable water supplies and waste water treatment, if they exist at all. Over 70% of Mexico City's potable water from the aquifer below it, which is being overexploited, causing the city to sink.\nThe south of the Federal District contains a number of ecological reserves; one of the most important being the Ajusco reserve. Growth pushing of the edges of this reserve has been causing both economic and political struggles which include fraudulent real estate schemes, illegal development of ejidal property, along with popular resistance and opposition movements. A major problem is the illegal movement of the poor building shantytowns, then resisting eviction, often with violence, often until the government gives into demands to build popular-sector housing in the area.  While such housing is needed, the whole process is ecologically destructive."

                "The first skyscraper, 40-story Torre Latinoamericana was built in the 1950s. All of these were in the main core of the city, laid out in the sixteenth century.\nA major departure in location and scale was the construction of the Ciudad Universitaria from 1950 to 1953 in the south of the city.  It had a noticeable effect on subsequent architecture in the city. The most notable buildings are the Rector\u00eda designed by Salvador Ortega, Mario Pani and Enrique del Moral, the Library, by Juan O'Gorman, Gustavo Saavedra and Juan Mart\u00ednez de Velasco and the Science Building by Ra\u00fal Cacho, Eugenio Peschard and F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez. Much of what makes the campus culturally significant is its huge murals that decorate the facades of many of the buildings.  These murals were done by Diego Rivera, David Siqueiros and others, with themes relating to Mexican history and identity.\n\nThe 1968 Olympic Games brought about the construction of large sporting facilities such as the Palacio de los Deportes (Sports Palace), the Vel\u00f3dromo Ol\u00edmpico and the 24 buildings of the Olympic Village. \n\n \n\nThe construction of the Mexico City Metro was not ready in time for the 1968 Olympics, but in 1969, Line 1, the \"Pink Line\" the underground rapid transit system of the city, was inaugurated by President Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz. The subway system was a huge infrastructure project, designed to be mass transit for those in Mexico City without cars.  There had been proposals for a subway system dating back decades, but political forces in favor of car owners (middle class and elites) blocked the plans for underground mass transit. The subway system allows for movement of large numbers of people to increasingly far flung areas of the city. When the Ciudad Universitaria opened, which relocated UNAM to the south of the city, there was no metro line.\nExplosive growth in the population of the city started from the 1960s, with the population overflowing the boundaries of the Federal District into neighboring state of Mexico, especially to the north, northwest and northeast. Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to 8,831,079. Under relentless growth, Mexico City had lost its charm by the 1970s, when the government could barely keep up with services. Mexico City was choking in smog and pollution. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shanty towns that extended for many miles.\nMexico City is still the cultural, economic, and industrial center for the nation. With a metropolitan-area population approaching 20 million, roughly equivalent to the entire state of Texas, it is a magnet of growth. People in large numbers still migrate from rural areas to the city in search of work and the other economic. Many of these immigrants settle illegally in the urban fringe with the hope that the government will eventually provide public services. The provision of water and wastewater service for the growing population of Mexico City is the problem air pollution was in the 1970s and 1980s. Such growth rates and patterns mean substandard potable water supplies and waste water treatment, if they exist at all. Over 70% of Mexico City's potable water from the aquifer below it, which is being overexploited, causing the city to sink.\nThe south of the Federal District contains a number of ecological reserves; one of the most important being the Ajusco reserve. Growth pushing of the edges of this reserve has been causing both economic and political struggles which include fraudulent real estate schemes, illegal development of ejidal property, along with popular resistance and opposition movements. A major problem is the illegal movement of the poor building shantytowns, then resisting eviction, often with violence, often until the government gives into demands to build popular-sector housing in the area.  While such housing is needed, the whole process is ecologically destructive."

The city's population more than doubled during this time, leading to a strain on services and resources. The government struggled to keep up with providing basic services such as housing, water, and wastewater treatment. \n\nThe rapid population growth also led to the creation of huge shanty towns on the outskirts of the city as migrants from rural areas poured in seeking work. These informal settlements lacked proper infrastructure and services, further exacerbating the strain on the city. The government faced challenges in providing public services to these areas, leading to substandard living conditions for many residents.\n\nIn terms of environmental issues, Mexico City was choking in smog and pollution during this time. The overexploitation of the aquifer below the city led to the city sinking, causing further environmental concerns. Additionally, growth pushing towards ecological reserves like the Ajusco reserve led to economic and political struggles, including fraudulent real estate schemes and illegal development. The illegal movement of the poor building shantytowns in these areas further exacerbated environmental degradation and led to conflicts with the government.",

In the 1940s, the city government froze rents so that until 1998, when the government repealed the law, tenants were still paying what they were in the 1950s. With no financial incentive to keep up their properties, landlords let their buildings disintegrate. The 1985 earthquake took its toll on a number of these structures, which were never fixed or rebuilt, leading to slums with and garbage-strewn vacant lots. The result was the loss of about 100,000 residents of the \"Colonia Centro\", leaving the area almost deserted at night.\nBy the 1980s, so much had fled the Centro that many of its former mansions were either abandoned or turned into tenements for the poor, and its sidewalks and streets taken over by pickpockets and milling vendors. For many people, especially international visitors, Mexico City's reputation for pollution, traffic and crime has made the city someplace \"get into and out of as fast as you can,\" seeing it as little more than an airport through which to make their connecting flights to the more attractive resort areas. Until recently, many of the restaurants of the area, even the best, would close early to allow employees time to get home because the area was not particularly safe at night.\n\nSince then the government has made efforts to revitalize this part of the city. Starting in the early 2000s, it infused 500 million pesos (US$55 million) into the Historic Center Trust and entered into a partnership with a business group led by Carlos Slim, to buy dozens of centuries-old buildings and other real estate to rehabilitate. Work began with renovating 34 blocks west of the Z\u00f3calo, digging up the antiquated drainage system and improving water supply. An architect was put in charge of each of the thirteen main streets to restore the facades of more than 500 buildings. The latest infrastructure projects of this type have been centered on the southeast portions of the area, on Rep\u00fablica de El Salvador, Talavera, Correo Mayor, Mesones and Pino Su\u00e1rez streets, mostly focusing on repaving streets and updating the very old drainage system of the area.  In the process, the construction is unearthing artifacts from the pre-Hispanic period to the present day.\nAll over the historic center, streets have been pedestrianized, buildings have been remodeled and restored, and new museums opened.  In the 1990s, after many years of controversy, protests and even riots, most street vendors were evicted to other parts of the city. The impetus to bring things back to the city center included the construction of the new mayoral residence just off the Z\u00f3calo. The government has buried electric and telephone cables in the area, and replaced old asphalt with paving stones. It has also installed nearly 100 security cameras to help with crime issues.

                "=== The city's political position ===\n\nFrom the days of the Aztecs, Mexico City has been the center of power for much of Mesoamerica and the Mexican nation. This centralism simply changed hands when the Spanish arrived, The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which came to power after the Mexican Revolution, again consolidated political power to the city, which benefited to the detriment of other parts of the country. The rapid expansion of Mexico City is related to the country's economic development in the period after World War II, the widening of the manufacturing sector, the success of the oil industry, and the country's proximity to U.S. markets. This growth allowed for the tolerance of PRI's authoritarianism. It still experienced economic growth up to the 1960s, but problems brought on by the one-party system were beginning to show. In 1968, Mexico City hosted the Summer Olympic Games. The event was meant to signal the prosperity of a developing nation, but serious problems had been masked by the PRI's authoritarian regime. Shortly before the inauguration of the Games, government troops massacred an unknown number of protesting students in Tlatelolco. However, the last straw may have been the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. On Thursday, 19 September 1985, at 7:19 am local time, Mexico City was struck by an earthquake of magnitude 8.1. on the Richter magnitude scale.  The event caused between three and four billion USD in damage as 412 buildings collapsed and another 3,124 were seriously damaged in the city. While the number is in dispute, the most-often cited number of deaths is about 10,000 people.\nWhile this earthquake was not as deadly or destructive as many similar events in Asia and other parts of Latin America it proved to be a disaster politically for the PRI. The government was paralyzed by its own bureaucracy and corruption, forcing ordinary citizens to not only create and direct their own rescue efforts but efforts to reconstruct much of the housing that was lost as well. This significantly affected politics in the years after the event. This discontent eventually led to Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas, a member of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, becoming the first elected mayor of Mexico City in 1997.  C\u00e1rdenas promised a more democratic government, and his party claimed some victories against crime, pollution, and other major problems.
